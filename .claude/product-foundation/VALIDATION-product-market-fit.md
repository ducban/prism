# Product-Market Fit (PMF) Framework / Khung Phù Hợp Sản Phẩm-Thị Trường

## Overview / Tổng Quan

**English:**
Product-Market Fit (PMF) is the degree to which a product satisfies strong market demand. It's the moment when your product becomes a "must-have" rather than a "nice-to-have."

**Marc Andreessen's Definition (2007):**
> "Product-market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market."

**Sean Ellis Test (The Gold Standard):**
Ask your users: *"How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?"*

- **≥40% answer "Very disappointed"** → You have PMF ✅
- **<40% answer "Very disappointed"** → No PMF yet ❌

**Why PMF Matters:**
- Without PMF: Marketing burns cash, users churn, growth is a struggle
- With PMF: Users pull your product into the market, retention is high, word-of-mouth happens naturally

**Real Example - Superhuman:**
- **2017**: 22% said "very disappointed" (No PMF)
- **2018**: Focused on users who loved it, rebuilt for their needs
- **2019**: 58% said "very disappointed" (Achieved PMF)
- **Result**: Grew from $0 to $20M ARR

**Vietnamese:**
Product-Market Fit (PMF) là mức độ sản phẩm thỏa mãn nhu cầu mạnh mẽ của thị trường. Đó là thời điểm sản phẩm trở thành "phải có" thay vì "nên có."

**Định Nghĩa của Marc Andreessen (2007):**
> "Phù hợp sản phẩm-thị trường có nghĩa là ở trong một thị trường tốt với một sản phẩm có thể thỏa mãn thị trường đó."

**Bài Test của Sean Ellis (Tiêu Chuẩn Vàng):**
Hỏi người dùng: *"Bạn sẽ cảm thấy thế nào nếu không thể sử dụng sản phẩm này nữa?"*

- **≥40% trả lời "Rất thất vọng"** → Bạn có PMF ✅
- **<40% trả lời "Rất thất vọng"** → Chưa có PMF ❌

**Tại Sao PMF Quan Trọng:**
- Không có PMF: Marketing tốn tiền, người dùng rời bỏ, tăng trưởng khó khăn
- Có PMF: Người dùng kéo sản phẩm vào thị trường, giữ chân cao, truyền miệng tự nhiên

**Ví Dụ Thực Tế - Superhuman:**
- **2017**: 22% nói "rất thất vọng" (Không PMF)
- **2018**: Tập trung vào người dùng yêu thích, xây dựng lại cho nhu cầu của họ
- **2019**: 58% nói "rất thất vọng" (Đạt PMF)
- **Kết Quả**: Tăng từ $0 lên $20M ARR

## The PMF Pyramid / Kim Tự Tháp PMF

**English:**

Dan Olsen's PMF Pyramid shows 5 layers needed for PMF:

```
         ┌─────────────────┐
         │   UX (Layer 5)  │
         ├─────────────────┤
         │ Feature Set (4) │
         ├─────────────────┤
         │ Value Prop (3)  │
         ├─────────────────┤
         │ Underserved     │
         │  Needs (2)      │
         ├─────────────────┤
         │ Target Customer │
         │    (Layer 1)    │
         └─────────────────┘
```

**Layer 1: Target Customer**
- Who has the problem you're solving?
- Be specific: "Busy parents" → "Working moms with kids under 5 in urban areas"

**Layer 2: Underserved Needs**
- What important needs are not being met?
- Focus on jobs, pains, and gains (see JTBD, Value Prop Canvas)

**Layer 3: Value Proposition**
- How does your product meet those needs better than alternatives?
- What's your unique value?

**Layer 4: Feature Set**
- What features deliver the value proposition?
- MVP = minimum features needed to test Layer 3

**Layer 5: UX**
- How easy and delightful is it to get value?
- This is often the differentiator between "works" and "love it"

**Vietnamese:**

Kim Tự Tháp PMF của Dan Olsen cho thấy 5 tầng cần thiết cho PMF:

**Tầng 1: Khách Hàng Mục Tiêu**
- Ai có vấn đề bạn đang giải quyết?
- Cụ thể: "Bố mẹ bận rộn" → "Mẹ làm việc có con dưới 5 tuổi ở khu vực đô thị"

**Tầng 2: Nhu Cầu Chưa Được Đáp Ứng**
- Nhu cầu quan trọng nào chưa được đáp ứng?
- Tập trung vào công việc, nỗi đau, và lợi ích

**Tầng 3: Giá Trị Đề Xuất**
- Sản phẩm của bạn đáp ứng nhu cầu đó tốt hơn các lựa chọn khác như thế nào?

**Tầng 4: Tập Hợp Tính Năng**
- Tính năng nào mang lại giá trị đề xuất?

**Tầng 5: Trải Nghiệm Người Dùng**
- Dễ dàng và thú vị như thế nào để nhận giá trị?

## Measuring PMF: The Sean Ellis Test / Đo Lường PMF

**English:**

### The PMF Survey (4 Questions)

**Question 1: The PMF Question (Most Important)**
> "How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"
- Very disappointed
- Somewhat disappointed
- Not disappointed (it isn't really that useful)
- N/A - I no longer use [product]

**Scoring:**
- **≥40% "Very disappointed"** = PMF achieved ✅
- **25-40%** = Getting close, needs work 🟡
- **<25%** = No PMF yet ❌

**Question 2: User Type**
> "What type of people do you think would most benefit from [product]?"
- Purpose: Identify your core audience

**Question 3: Main Benefit**
> "What is the main benefit you receive from [product]?"
- Purpose: Understand your value proposition

**Question 4: Improvement**
> "How can we improve [product] for you?"
- Purpose: Prioritize feature development

### How to Run the Survey

1. **Who to Survey**: Active users who have used your product at least 2-3 times
2. **Sample Size**: Minimum 40 responses (ideally 100+)
3. **Timing**: Survey after users have experienced core value (e.g., after 1 week of use)
4. **Tool**: Typeform, Google Forms, or in-app survey

### Interpreting Results

**Scenario A: High PMF Score (≥40%)**
- ✅ You have PMF!
- Next: Scale through marketing and sales
- Focus: Doubling down on what works

**Scenario B: Medium PMF Score (25-40%)**
- 🟡 Close but not there yet
- Next: Identify the segment that loves you (analyze Q2 & Q3)
- Focus: Build for that segment, ignore others temporarily

**Scenario C: Low PMF Score (<25%)**
- ❌ No PMF yet
- Next: Talk to users, understand why (Q3 & Q4)
- Focus: Pivot or iterate on value proposition

**Vietnamese:**

### Khảo Sát PMF (4 Câu Hỏi)

**Câu Hỏi 1: Câu Hỏi PMF (Quan Trọng Nhất)**
> "Bạn sẽ cảm thấy thế nào nếu không thể sử dụng [sản phẩm] nữa?"

**Chấm Điểm:**
- **≥40% "Rất thất vọng"** = Đạt PMF ✅
- **25-40%** = Đang đến gần, cần cải thiện 🟡
- **<25%** = Chưa có PMF ❌

**Câu Hỏi 2**: Loại người dùng nào được hưởng lợi nhiều nhất?
**Câu Hỏi 3**: Lợi ích chính bạn nhận được là gì?
**Câu Hỏi 4**: Chúng tôi có thể cải thiện như thế nào?

## Alternative PMF Metrics / Chỉ Số PMF Thay Thế

**English:**

While the Sean Ellis test is the gold standard, here are other signals:

### 1. Retention Cohorts
- **What**: % of users still active after 30, 60, 90 days
- **PMF Signal**: Retention curve flattens (not dropping to zero)
- **Example**: WhatsApp has 70% D30 retention

### 2. Organic Growth Rate
- **What**: Growth from word-of-mouth (not paid)
- **PMF Signal**: >20% month-over-month organic growth
- **Example**: Dropbox grew 3900% in 15 months (mostly referrals)

### 3. Net Promoter Score (NPS)
- **What**: "How likely are you to recommend [product]?" (0-10 scale)
- **PMF Signal**: NPS > 50
- **Formula**: % Promoters (9-10) - % Detractors (0-6)

### 4. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Payback
- **What**: Time to recover cost of acquiring customer
- **PMF Signal**: <12 months payback
- **Formula**: CAC / (Monthly Revenue per Customer)

### 5. Engagement Metrics
- **What**: DAU/MAU ratio (Daily Active / Monthly Active)
- **PMF Signal**:
  - Social products: >20%
  - SaaS products: >40%
  - Consumer apps: >60%

### 6. Churn Rate
- **What**: % of users who stop using your product
- **PMF Signal**:
  - Consumer: <5% monthly churn
  - B2B: <2% monthly churn

**Vietnamese:**

### Tín Hiệu PMF Thay Thế:

1. **Độ Giữ Chân** (Retention): Đường cong phẳng, không giảm về 0
2. **Tăng Trưởng Tự Nhiên**: >20% mỗi tháng từ truyền miệng
3. **NPS**: >50 điểm
4. **Hoàn Vốn CAC**: <12 tháng
5. **Tương Tác**: DAU/MAU >20-60% tùy loại sản phẩm
6. **Tỷ Lệ Rời Bỏ**: <5% mỗi tháng (consumer), <2% (B2B)

## The Path to PMF: 5 Stages / Con Đường Đến PMF

**English:**

### Stage 1: Problem-Solution Fit
**Question**: Do people have the problem you think they have?
**Method**: User interviews, surveys, pain point validation
**Output**: Validated problem hypothesis

### Stage 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
**Question**: Does your solution actually solve the problem?
**Method**: Build simplest version, test with early adopters
**Output**: Working prototype with core value

### Stage 3: Product-Market Fit
**Question**: Do people love your product?
**Method**: Sean Ellis test, retention analysis
**Output**: ≥40% "very disappointed", strong retention

### Stage 4: Scale & Growth
**Question**: Can you profitably acquire customers?
**Method**: Marketing experiments, sales process
**Output**: Positive unit economics, repeatable growth

### Stage 5: Market Leadership
**Question**: Can you dominate the market?
**Method**: Network effects, brand building
**Output**: Category leader, high market share

**Most Companies Fail Between Stage 2-3**
- They build something, but it doesn't achieve PMF
- Don't give up on Stage 2 - iterate until you reach Stage 3

**Vietnamese:**

### 5 Giai Đoạn Đến PMF:

1. **Phù Hợp Vấn Đề-Giải Pháp**: Người ta có vấn đề bạn nghĩ không?
2. **MVP**: Giải pháp của bạn có thực sự giải quyết vấn đề không?
3. **Product-Market Fit**: Người ta có yêu thích sản phẩm không?
4. **Mở Rộng & Tăng Trưởng**: Bạn có thể thu hút khách hàng có lãi không?
5. **Dẫn Đầu Thị Trường**: Bạn có thể thống trị thị trường không?

**Hầu hết công ty thất bại giữa Giai Đoạn 2-3**

## Playbook: Finding PMF with Superhuman's Process / Sách Hướng Dẫn

**English:**

**Case Study: How Superhuman Went from 22% to 58% PMF Score**

### Step 1: Segment Users (Week 1)
1. Run Sean Ellis survey
2. Create 4 segments:
   - **High-expectation customers**: "Very disappointed" + high usage
   - **Developing customers**: Other active users
   - **Detractors**: Not satisfied
   - **Prospects**: Haven't signed up yet

### Step 2: Analyze High-Expectation Customers (Week 2)
- Study Q2: Who are they? (Role, industry, use case)
- Study Q3: What do they love? (Main benefit)
- Find common patterns

**Superhuman's Discovery:**
- High-expectation customers: Executives & VCs
- Main benefit: "Speed" (keyboard shortcuts, fast email)
- Common pattern: They process 100+ emails/day

### Step 3: Double Down (Weeks 3-8)
- Build features for high-expectation customers ONLY
- Ignore requests from other segments temporarily
- Make the product even better for those who already love it

**Superhuman's Actions:**
- Added more keyboard shortcuts
- Improved speed (sub-100ms response time)
- Built email triage features for high-volume users

### Step 4: Expand Thoughtfully (Weeks 9-12)
- Survey again - PMF score should increase
- Identify next adjacent segment
- Repeat process

**Superhuman's Result:**
- PMF score: 22% → 58% in 12 months
- Revenue: $0 → $20M ARR in 2 years

**Vietnamese:**

**Quy Trình Superhuman: 22% → 58% PMF**

**Bước 1**: Phân khúc người dùng (4 nhóm)
**Bước 2**: Phân tích nhóm "rất thất vọng" - họ là ai? Họ thích gì?
**Bước 3**: Tập trung 100% vào nhóm đó
**Bước 4**: Mở rộng sang nhóm kế tiếp

**Kết Quả**: 22% → 58% trong 12 tháng

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid / Sai Lầm Thường Gặp

### Mistake 1: Surveying the Wrong People
**Problem**: Surveying people who haven't used your product or used it once

**Why It's Wrong**: They haven't experienced enough value to know if they'd miss it

**Solution**:
- Only survey users who've used your product ≥3 times
- Wait until they've completed a core workflow
- Filter out inactive users from results

### Mistake 2: Pivoting Too Early
**Problem**: Getting 30% PMF score and immediately pivoting

**Why It's Wrong**: You might be close - sometimes 30% → 40% is just a few feature improvements away

**Solution**:
- If score is 25-40%, dig deeper into Q2-Q4
- Identify and double down on users who love you
- Only pivot if score is <20% after 6+ months

### Mistake 3: Trying to Please Everyone
**Problem**: Building features for detractors instead of fans

**Why It's Wrong**: Dilutes your product, confuses your positioning

**Solution**:
- Ignore feature requests from detractors (for now)
- Make fans LOVE you even more
- Expand to adjacent segments only after hitting 40%

### Mistake 4: Confusing PMF with Growth
**Problem**: "We're growing fast, we must have PMF!"

**Why It's Wrong**: You can have growth without PMF (paid acquisition), but it's unsustainable

**Solution**:
- Check retention: Are users staying?
- Check organic growth: Is it word-of-mouth or all paid?
- Check NPS: Would users recommend you?

### Mistake 5: Declaring PMF Too Early
**Problem**: Hitting 40% with 50 users and declaring victory

**Why It's Wrong**: Small sample size, not representative

**Solution**:
- Wait for minimum 40 responses (ideally 100+)
- Validate with other metrics (retention, NPS, organic growth)
- Be honest - PMF is a gradient, not a binary

### Mistake 6: Stopping After Achieving PMF
**Problem**: "We hit 40%, we're done!"

**Why It's Wrong**: PMF can be lost, markets change, competition emerges

**Solution**:
- Re-survey quarterly
- Monitor retention continuously
- Keep improving product

## When to Use PMF Framework / Khi Nào Sử Dụng

### Use PMF Framework When:
- ✅ You've launched an MVP and have early users
- ✅ You're deciding whether to scale or iterate
- ✅ You're not sure if users truly love your product
- ✅ Retention is unclear or declining
- ✅ You're considering a pivot

### Don't Use PMF Framework When:
- ❌ You haven't launched yet (use Problem-Solution Fit instead)
- ❌ You have <20 active users (not enough data)
- ❌ You're in enterprise sales with long sales cycles (use different metrics)

## Related Frameworks / Khung Liên Quan

### Value Proposition Canvas
**Relationship**: Use BEFORE PMF to design your value prop
- Helps ensure you're solving real pains
- Feeds into PMF Layer 2-3

### North Star Framework
**Relationship**: Use AFTER achieving PMF
- PMF tells you IF users love you
- North Star tells you WHAT to optimize for growth

### AARRR Pirate Metrics
**Relationship**: PMF affects all AARRR stages
- Without PMF: Acquisition is expensive, Retention is low
- With PMF: Acquisition is easier, Retention is high, Referral happens naturally

### Retention & Churn Analysis
**Relationship**: Complementary measurement
- PMF survey = qualitative ("How do you feel?")
- Retention cohorts = quantitative ("Do they stay?")

---

## Quick Reference Card / Thẻ Tham Khảo Nhanh

### The Sean Ellis Test
**Question**: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?"

**PMF Score**: % who answer "Very disappointed"
- **≥40%** = PMF ✅
- **25-40%** = Close 🟡
- **<25%** = No PMF ❌

### Other PMF Signals
- Retention curve flattens
- NPS > 50
- >20% MoM organic growth
- DAU/MAU > 20-60% (depending on product type)
- <5% monthly churn (consumer) or <2% (B2B)

### Path to PMF
1. Problem-Solution Fit → 2. MVP → 3. PMF → 4. Scale → 5. Market Leadership

### Superhuman's Process
1. Survey users (Sean Ellis test)
2. Segment by PMF score
3. Analyze "very disappointed" users
4. Double down on that segment
5. Repeat until >40%
