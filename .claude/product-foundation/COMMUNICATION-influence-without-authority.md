# Influence Without Authority / Ảnh Hưởng Không Có Quyền Lực

## Overview / Tổng Quan

**English:**
As a Product Manager, you're responsible for outcomes but don't have authority over most people you work with. You can't order Engineering to build, Design to create, or Sales to sell. You must influence, persuade, and build alignment.

**The PM's Reality:**
- **Responsibility**: Ship valuable products, hit OKRs, drive revenue
- **Authority**: Zero (in most orgs, PMs don't have direct reports who build the product)
- **Challenge**: Get Engineering, Design, Sales, Marketing, and Execs aligned
- **Solution**: Master influence without authority

**Why This Matters:**

**The Data:**
- **Google Study**: 87% of PM effectiveness comes from influencing skills (not technical or business skills)
- **Stanford Research**: Cross-functional influence predicts project success better than budget or timeline
- **Career Impact**: Promotion to senior PM/Director depends on ability to influence at scale

**Real Example - Instagram's Explore Tab (2012):**
**Context**: PM wanted to build "Explore" (personalized feed discovery)
**Challenge**: No authority over:
- Engineering (reported to Eng VP)
- Design (reported to Design VP)
- Data Science (reported to Data VP)
- All were overloaded with other projects

**PM's Influence Strategy:**

**1. Engineering**: Built prototype in 2 days, showed it working
- Result: Engineers excited, volunteered to refine

**2. Design**: Framed as "help users discover their passions" (design loves user value)
- Result: Designer championed it in design review

**3. Data Science**: Shared hypothesis "increase DAU by showing relevant content"
- Result: DS built personalization model

**4. Leadership**: Showed prototype to CEO with early metrics (+15% session time)
- Result: CEO made it a company priority

**Outcome**: Explore launched in 4 months, became #2 driver of engagement after Feed.

**Key**: PM influenced each group differently, speaking to their motivations.

**Vietnamese:**
Là Product Manager, bạn chịu trách nhiệm về kết quả nhưng không có quyền lực đối với hầu hết người bạn làm việc cùng. Bạn không thể ra lệnh Engineering xây dựng, Design tạo, hay Sales bán. Bạn phải ảnh hưởng, thuyết phục và xây dựng sự thống nhất.

**Thực Tế của PM:**
- **Trách nhiệm**: Ship sản phẩm có giá trị, đạt OKRs
- **Quyền lực**: Không (PM không có báo cáo trực tiếp)
- **Thách thức**: Căn chỉnh Engineering, Design, Sales, Marketing, Execs
- **Giải pháp**: Thành thạo ảnh hưởng không quyền lực

**Tại Sao Quan Trọng:**
- Google: 87% hiệu quả PM đến từ kỹ năng ảnh hưởng
- Stanford: Ảnh hưởng liên chức năng dự đoán thành công dự án

## The Cohen-Bradford Model / Mô Hình Cohen-Bradford

**English:**

The foundational framework for influence without authority.

### The Core Principle: Currencies of Exchange

**Influence is an exchange**: You give something they value, they give something you need.

**The Influence Formula:**
```
Influence = (What They Want) × (What You Offer) × (Relationship Trust)
```

### The Six Currencies

**1. Inspiration-Related Currencies** (For Visionaries)
- **Vision**: Compelling future state
- **Excellence**: Opportunity to do great work
- **Moral/Ethical**: Alignment with values

**Example**:
- **You need**: Designer to prioritize your project
- **They want**: To build beautiful, user-loved products
- **Exchange**: "This will solve real user pain and showcase your best work"

**2. Task-Related Currencies** (For Doers)
- **Resources**: Budget, tools, headcount
- **Challenge**: Interesting problems to solve
- **Learning**: New skills, growth opportunities

**Example**:
- **You need**: Engineer to build complex feature
- **They want**: To learn new technology
- **Exchange**: "You'll get to work with GraphQL and Kubernetes"

**3. Position-Related Currencies** (For Career-Focused)
- **Recognition**: Visibility, credit
- **Reputation**: Looking good to leadership
- **Network**: Connections to important people
- **Advancement**: Path to promotion

**Example**:
- **You need**: Senior IC to mentor team
- **They want**: To be seen as leader (promo to Staff)
- **Exchange**: "You'll be tech lead, present to VP, showcase leadership"

**4. Relationship-Related Currencies** (For Collaborators)
- **Understanding**: Being listened to
- **Inclusion**: Being part of decisions
- **Support**: Backing when they need it

**Example**:
- **You need**: Designer's buy-in on direction
- **They want**: To feel heard and valued
- **Exchange**: "What are your concerns? Let's co-create the solution."

**5. Personal-Related Currencies** (For Individuals)
- **Gratitude**: Appreciation, thanks
- **Ownership**: Autonomy and control
- **Self-concept**: Reinforcing their identity

**Example**:
- **You need**: Engineer to fix bugs
- **They want**: To be seen as quality-focused
- **Exchange**: "This aligns with your commitment to user experience quality"

**6. Political Currencies** (For Power Players)
- **Information**: Early access to news
- **Alliances**: Partnerships
- **Autonomy**: Freedom from oversight

**Example**:
- **You need**: VP's approval for project
- **They want**: To look good to CEO
- **Exchange**: "This directly supports the CEO's OKR on growth"

### How to Apply the Model

**Step 1: Diagnose What They Want**
- What are their goals? (OKRs, career, reputation)
- What motivates them? (Currency type)
- What are their pain points?

**Step 2: Inventory What You Can Offer**
- What currencies do you control?
- What value can you provide?
- How does your request align with their goals?

**Step 3: Make the Exchange**
- Frame your ask in terms of their benefit
- Be explicit about the exchange
- Deliver on your promises

**Real Example - Airbnb PM:**

**Situation**: PM needs Data Science team to build pricing algorithm
**Diagnose**:
- DS team wants: Interesting ML problems, publications, recognition
- DS team's pain: Too many ad-hoc requests, low-impact projects

**Inventory**:
- You offer: Complex ML problem (dynamic pricing), large dataset
- You offer: Co-authorship on blog post about the algorithm
- You offer: Executive visibility (present to CEO)

**Exchange**:
"This is the hardest ML problem at Airbnb right now—dynamic pricing for 5M listings across 190 countries. It's publication-worthy. If we nail this, we'll present to Brian [CEO]. Want to co-lead?"

**Result**: DS team prioritized it, algorithm increased revenue 10%, DS published paper, DS lead got promoted.

**Vietnamese:**

### Nguyên Tắc Cốt Lõi: Đồng Tiền Trao Đổi

**Ảnh hưởng là trao đổi**: Bạn cho thứ họ coi trọng, họ cho thứ bạn cần.

### Sáu Đồng Tiền:

**1. Đồng tiền cảm hứng**: Tầm nhìn, sự xuất sắc
**2. Đồng tiền nhiệm vụ**: Tài nguyên, thách thức, học tập
**3. Đồng tiền vị trí**: Sự công nhận, danh tiếng, thăng tiến
**4. Đồng tiền mối quan hệ**: Hiểu biết, hòa nhập, hỗ trợ
**5. Đồng tiền cá nhân**: Lòng biết ơn, quyền sở hữu
**6. Đồng tiền chính trị**: Thông tin, liên minh, tự chủ

## Building Alignment: The Playbook / Xây Dựng Sự Thống Nhất

**English:**

### Pre-Work: Map the Landscape

**1. Identify Key Players**
- [ ] Who has to say "yes" for this to happen?
- [ ] Who could block it?
- [ ] Who will do the work?
- [ ] Who influences decision-makers?

**2. Assess Current State**
- [ ] Who's already aligned? (Allies)
- [ ] Who's neutral? (Persuadables)
- [ ] Who's opposed? (Resisters)

**3. Understand Motivations**

For each person, ask:
- What are their goals this quarter?
- What makes them look good?
- What are they worried about?
- What's their preferred communication style?

**Tool: Influence Mapping Template**

| Name | Role | Current Stance | What They Want | What I Offer | Approach |
|------|------|---------------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Sarah | Eng Lead | Neutral | Recognition, interesting work | Tech lead role, visibility to CTO | Position Currency: "You'll present to CTO" |
| Mike | Designer | Opposed | User research time, not rushed | Extra week, user testing budget | Task Currency: "We'll do proper research" |
| Jane | VP Product | Allied | Hit OKR on engagement | This project drives engagement | Political Currency: "Aligns with your OKR" |

### Influence Strategy: The Five Tactics

**Tactic 1: Build Relationships First (Foundational)**

**Before you need something:**
- Coffee chats (learn about them)
- Help them with their projects
- Share information that helps them
- Build trust bank account

**Example**:
Don't: Slack someone you never talk to: "Can you help me with X?"
Do: Regular check-ins → build rapport → when you need help, they're happy to

**Real Example - Stripe PM:**
PM spent first month at Stripe having coffee with all 50 engineers:
- Learned their interests, goals, frustrations
- Shared context from user research
- Asked "How can I help you be successful?"
Result: When PM needed engineers for project, 10 volunteered

**Tactic 2: Involve Early (Co-Creation)**

**Principle**: People support what they create

**Don't**:
- Build spec in isolation → present finished plan → "Can you build this?"
- Result: Pushback, "This won't work because..."

**Do**:
- Share problem early → "Help me think through this?"
- Collaborate on solution
- Result: Ownership, "We should build..."

**Example**:
❌ Bad: "I spec'd out the checkout redesign. Please review."
✅ Good: "I'm thinking about checkout. Can I show you user research and get your thoughts on solutions?"

**Tactic 3: Speak Their Language (Tailored Messaging)**

**Engineering**:
- Talk: Technical trade-offs, architecture, scalability
- Show: PRD with edge cases, data models, API contracts
- Value: Interesting problems, good practices, avoiding tech debt

**Design**:
- Talk: User needs, pain points, UX principles
- Show: User research, personas, user flows
- Value: Solving real problems, beautiful work, user love

**Sales**:
- Talk: Revenue impact, competitive advantages, customer wins
- Show: ROI models, customer quotes, demo videos
- Value: Closing deals, looking good to customers, quota attainment

**Finance**:
- Talk: ROI, payback period, NPV, cost savings
- Show: Spreadsheets, financial models, business cases
- Value: Fiscal responsibility, predictable returns

**Leadership**:
- Talk: Strategic alignment, market opportunity, competitive positioning
- Show: One-pagers, exec summaries, vision docs
- Value: Winning, company success, hitting OKRs

**Example - Same Project, Different Audiences:**

**To Engineering**: "This will reduce our API latency from 500ms to 50ms, making the system more scalable."

**To Design**: "User research shows 67% of users abandon during this flow because of confusion."

**To Sales**: "This will help you close 20% more deals by removing the #1 objection."

**To CFO**: "This will increase conversion by 15%, generating $2M additional ARR."

**To CEO**: "This positions us as the fastest product in the category, differentiated from competitors."

**Tactic 4: Make It Easy to Say Yes (Reduce Friction)**

**Reduce Risk**:
- Start with small ask (pilot, prototype)
- Show data/proof (not just ideas)
- Offer to do the work ("I'll write the spec, you review")

**Reduce Effort**:
- Make your ask crystal clear
- Provide everything they need
- Remove blockers proactively

**Example**:

**Hard to Say Yes**:
"Can we redesign the entire checkout flow?"
- Huge scope, high risk, unclear ROI

**Easy to Say Yes**:
"Can we A/B test a single step (payment form) with 5% of traffic? I've already built the Figma mocks and written the spec. Just need 1 engineer for 3 days."
- Small, low-risk, clear ask, easy to resource

**Tactic 5: Build Momentum (Coalition of the Willing)**

**Principle**: Start with allies, build coalition, then approach resisters

**The Playbook**:

**Step 1**: Get easy "yes" from allies
- They believe in the idea
- Get them to vocally support

**Step 2**: Use social proof with neutrals
- "Sarah and Mike are already on board"
- "3 teams are asking for this"

**Step 3**: Address resisters
- They see momentum
- Harder to say no when others support

**Example - Slack's Emoji Reactions:**

**Week 1**: PM pitched to CEO (ally) → CEO loved it
**Week 2**: PM pitched to Engineering (neutral) → "CEO is excited, can we prototype?"
**Week 3**: Engineers built prototype, shared in company Slack
**Week 4**: Everyone using it, loving it
**Week 5**: Launch team (former resisters) → "Let's ship it"

**Result**: Emoji reactions became core feature, used billions of times.

**Vietnamese:**

### Năm Chiến Thuật:

**1. Xây dựng mối quan hệ trước**: Coffee chats, giúp đỡ
**2. Tham gia sớm**: Co-creation, ownership
**3. Nói ngôn ngữ của họ**: Tailored messaging
**4. Làm cho dễ nói có**: Giảm rủi ro, giảm nỗ lực
**5. Xây dựng động lực**: Allies → Neutrals → Resisters

## Cross-Functional Leadership / Lãnh Đạo Liên Chức Năng

**English:**

### Leading Without Authority: The Mindset

**Traditional Leadership** (Authority):
- "Do this because I'm your manager"
- Command and control
- Hierarchy

**PM Leadership** (Influence):
- "Do this because it's the right thing for users/company"
- Persuade and align
- Network

### The PM as "Glue"

Your job is to connect the dots:

```
        [CEO/Leadership]
              ↕️
         [PM - You] ←→ [Engineering]
              ↕️           ↕️
        [Design] ←→ [Data Science]
              ↕️           ↕️
        [Sales] ←→ [Marketing]
              ↕️
        [Customers]
```

You're the hub that:
- Translates business goals → technical requirements
- Translates user needs → design specs
- Translates technical constraints → business trade-offs
- Aligns everyone toward common goal

### Building Cross-Functional Trust

**1. Demonstrate Competence**
- Know your space (market, users, data)
- Make good decisions
- Admit when you don't know

**2. Show Reliability**
- Do what you say
- Meet deadlines
- Follow through

**3. Exhibit Integrity**
- Be honest about trade-offs
- Give credit to others
- Admit mistakes

**4. Demonstrate Care**
- Understand their challenges
- Make their lives easier
- Celebrate their wins

**Real Example - Google PM (Susan Wojcicki):**

**Context**: Susan PM'd AdSense (Google's ad product)

**Cross-Functional Challenge**:
- Engineering wanted to rebuild entire system (6 months)
- Sales wanted new features NOW (to hit quota)
- Finance wanted to cut costs
- Legal worried about compliance

**Susan's Approach**:

**Engineering**: "I know you want to rebuild. What if we do incremental refactoring—ship features while improving architecture?"
- Result: Engineers felt heard, agreed to hybrid approach

**Sales**: "I'll prioritize 3 features that close deals. Which 3?"
- Result: Sales felt included, focused asks

**Finance**: "I'll reduce server costs by optimizing code. Give me 1 quarter."
- Result: CFO gave time, PM delivered 30% cost reduction

**Legal**: "I'll embed compliance review in every sprint."
- Result: Legal trusted process, didn't block launches

**Outcome**: AdSense grew from $20M → $2B in 3 years. Susan promoted to CEO of YouTube.

**Key**: Susan influenced each function by understanding their needs and finding win-wins.

### Resolving Cross-Functional Conflicts

**Conflict Pattern 1: Engineering vs Sales**
- **Engineering**: "We need to fix tech debt"
- **Sales**: "We need features to close deals"

**PM's Role**: Mediator
- **To Engineering**: "I agree tech debt matters. Can we allocate 20% of each sprint?"
- **To Sales**: "I agree we need features. Which 3 will close the most revenue?"
- **Solution**: 80% features, 20% tech debt (balanced)

**Conflict Pattern 2: Design vs Speed**
- **Design**: "We need 3 weeks for research and iteration"
- **Leadership**: "We need to launch in 2 weeks"

**PM's Role**: Negotiator
- **To Design**: "What's the minimum research to derisk? Can we do guerrilla testing?"
- **To Leadership**: "Can we launch MVP in 2 weeks, iterate in v2?"
- **Solution**: Launch fast, iterate (progressive refinement)

**Conflict Pattern 3: Data vs Intuition**
- **Data**: "The data says users want X"
- **Leadership**: "My intuition says Y"

**PM's Role**: Synthesizer
- **To Both**: "Let's A/B test both. Data + intuition together."
- **Solution**: Test and learn

**Vietnamese:**

### PM Là "Keo"

Công việc của bạn là kết nối các điểm:
- Dịch mục tiêu kinh doanh → yêu cầu kỹ thuật
- Dịch nhu cầu người dùng → spec thiết kế
- Dịch ràng buộc kỹ thuật → đánh đổi kinh doanh

### Xây Dựng Niềm Tin Liên Chức Năng:
1. Thể hiện năng lực
2. Thể hiện độ tin cậy
3. Thể hiện sự chính trực
4. Thể hiện sự quan tâm

- Build your reputation
- Show expertise
- Be consistent

**Pathos (Emotion)**
- Tell stories
- Show user pain
- Create urgency

**Logos (Logic)**
- Use data
- Show ROI
- Present evidence

### The Persuasion Playbook

**Technique 1: The "Yes Ladder"**
- Get series of small "yes" → big "yes"

**Example**:
1. "Do you agree users are frustrated with checkout?" (Yes)
2. "Should we improve it?" (Yes)
3. "Can we test this hypothesis?" (Yes)
4. "Can we allocate resources to build the winner?" (Yes)

**Technique 2: The "Door in the Face"**
- Ask for big thing (get no) → ask for smaller thing (get yes)

**Example**:
- "Can we get 10 engineers for 6 months?" (No)
- "What about 2 engineers for 2 months?" (Yes)

**Technique 3: The "Foot in the Door"**
- Ask for tiny thing (get yes) → ask for bigger thing

**Example**:
- "Can we spend 2 days exploring this?" (Yes)
- "The prototype looks good. Can we build it?" (Yes)

**Technique 4: Social Proof**
- "Others are doing this"

**Example**:
- "Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon all use this approach"
- "5 customers have requested this"
- "Our competitor just launched it"

**Technique 5: Scarcity/Urgency**
- "Limited time or opportunity"

**Example**:
- "Competitor launching in Q3"
- "Market window closing"
- "Eng team available now, not next quarter"

**Technique 6: Authority**
- Leverage experts, data, research

**Example**:
- "According to Gartner..."
- "Our data scientist analyzed..."
- "Industry benchmark is..."

**Technique 7: The "Win-Win" Frame**
- Show how it benefits them

**Example**:
❌ "I need you to build this"
✅ "This will help you hit your OKR on performance (and solve user problem)"

**Technique 8: The "Ask"**
- Be specific, direct, clear

**Example**:
❌ "What do you think?" (vague)
✅ "Can I get 2 engineers for 3 weeks starting April 1?" (specific)

**Vietnamese:**

### Ba Appeal (Aristotle):
**Ethos**: Uy tín
**Pathos**: Cảm xúc
**Logos**: Logic

### Kỹ Thuật:
1. **Yes Ladder**: Nhiều "yes" nhỏ → "yes" lớn
2. **Door in Face**: Yêu cầu lớn → yêu cầu nhỏ
3. **Foot in Door**: Yêu cầu nhỏ → yêu cầu lớn
4. **Social Proof**: "Người khác đang làm"
5. **Scarcity**: "Thời gian/cơ hội hạn chế"
6. **Authority**: Chuyên gia, dữ liệu
7. **Win-Win**: Lợi ích cho họ
8. **The Ask**: Cụ thể, trực tiếp

## Common Mistakes / Sai Lầm Thường Gặp

### Mistake 1: Asking Without Giving
**Problem**: "I need your help" (but you've never helped them)

**Why It Fails**: No relationship bank account

**Solution**: Build relationships first. Help others before you need help.

### Mistake 2: One-Size-Fits-All Pitch
**Problem**: Same message to Engineering, Design, Sales

**Why It Fails**: Different motivations, different languages

**Solution**: Tailor message to audience. Use their currency.

### Mistake 3: Positional Bargaining
**Problem**: "I want X, you want Y, let's compromise at middle"

**Why It Fails**: Both lose, neither gets what they really need

**Solution**: Understand underlying interests. Find win-win.

**Example**:
❌ "You want 4 weeks, I want 2 weeks, let's do 3 weeks"
✅ "You want time for research. I need to hit launch date. Can we do guerrilla testing (faster) and launch with iteration plan?"

### Mistake 4: Making It About You
**Problem**: "I need this for my roadmap"

**Why It Fails**: They don't care about your roadmap

**Solution**: Make it about them. "This helps you hit your OKR"

### Mistake 5: No Follow-Through
**Problem**: Promise to help, then don't deliver

**Why It Fails**: Destroys trust, reputation

**Solution**: Only promise what you can deliver. Then over-deliver.

### Mistake 6: Going Alone
**Problem**: Try to influence without allies

**Why It Fails**: Harder to convince skeptics alone

**Solution**: Build coalition. Start with allies, create momentum.

### Mistake 7: Being Transactional
**Problem**: Only talk to people when you need something

**Why It Fails**: Feels manipulative, no real relationship

**Solution**: Build genuine relationships. Care about their success.
