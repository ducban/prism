# North Star Framework / Khung Chỉ Số Ngôi Sao Phương Bắc

## Overview / Tổng Quan

**English:**
The North Star Metric (NSM) is the single metric that best captures the core value your product delivers to customers. It's the metric that predicts long-term success and customer satisfaction.

**What Makes a Good North Star:**
1. **Expresses value**: Measures customer value delivered
2. **Represents vision**: Aligns with company mission
3. **Predictive**: Leading indicator of revenue/success
4. **Actionable**: Teams can influence it
5. **Understandable**: Everyone knows what it means

**Why North Star Matters:**
- **Alignment**: Entire company optimizes one metric
- **Focus**: Prevents vanity metrics distraction
- **Speed**: Faster decisions (does it move NSM?)
- **Customer-centric**: Forces focus on user value

**Real Example - Spotify:**
- **North Star**: Time Spent Listening (TSL)
- **Why**: More listening = more value + more retention + more revenue
- **Not**: Sign-ups (vanity metric)
- **Not**: Songs played (incentivizes short songs)
- **Result**: Every team optimizes for TSL (discovery, quality, personalization)

**Vietnamese:**
North Star Metric (NSM) là chỉ số duy nhất phản ánh tốt nhất giá trị cốt lõi mà sản phẩm mang lại cho khách hàng.

**Đặc Điểm North Star Tốt:**
1. Thể hiện giá trị khách hàng
2. Đại diện cho tầm nhìn
3. Dự đoán thành công dài hạn
4. Có thể tác động
5. Dễ hiểu

**Ví Dụ - Spotify:**
- **North Star**: Thời gian nghe nhạc
- **Tại sao**: Nghe nhiều = giá trị + giữ chân + doanh thu
- **Kết quả**: Mọi đội đều tối ưu cho chỉ số này

## The North Star Framework / Khung North Star

**English:**

### Component 1: The North Star Metric

**The ONE metric that best predicts success**

**Criteria for Choosing:**
1. **Value Creation**: Does it measure value delivered to customers?
2. **Revenue Correlation**: Does it predict revenue?
3. **Long-term Focus**: Does it incentivize sustainable growth?
4. **Leading Indicator**: Does it predict future success?

**Test Questions:**
- If this metric goes up, does our business improve?
- If this metric goes down, are we in trouble?
- Can teams across the company impact this metric?

### Component 2: The Inputs (Work Streams)

**The 3-5 key drivers that move the North Star**

**Example - Airbnb:**
```
North Star: Nights Booked

2. Demand (guests searching)
3. Search-to-Book conversion
4. Repeat booking rate
```

**Example - Spotify:**
```
North Star: Time Spent Listening

Inputs:
1. New user activation (first listen)
2. Content discovery (finding music)
3. Playlist engagement

## Finding Your North Star: Playbook / Tìm North Star Của Bạn

**English:**

### Step 1: Identify Candidate Metrics (Week 1)

**Brainstorm Potential North Stars:**

Ask: "What action represents core value delivered?"

**For Different Business Models:**

**Consumer App:**
- Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active Users (DAU/WAU/MAU)
- Time spent in app
- Sessions per user
- Content created/shared

**SaaS:**
- Weekly active teams/users
- Value actions completed (e.g., reports generated)
- Collaboration events (e.g., docs shared)
- Data stored/processed

**Marketplace:**
- Transactions completed
- Gross merchandise value (GMV)
- Repeat purchase rate

**E-commerce:**
- Orders per month
- Items purchased
- Shopping frequency

### Step 2: Evaluate Against Criteria (Week 1)

**Score each candidate 1-5 on:**

| Metric | Value | Revenue | Sustainable | Actionable | Total |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Metric A | 4 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 16 |
| Metric B | 5 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 18 ← Winner |
| Metric C | 3 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 14 |

**Questions:**
1. **Value Creation** (1-5): Does increase = more customer value?
2. **Revenue Correlation** (1-5): Does it predict revenue?
3. **Sustainable** (1-5): Does it incentivize long-term health?
4. **Actionable** (1-5): Can teams influence it?

### Step 3: Define the Metric (Week 2)

**Be Specific:**

Bad: "Active Users"
Good: "Weekly Active Users who complete 3+ core actions"

**Components:**
- **Time frame**: Daily? Weekly? Monthly?
- **User segment**: All users? Paid? Teams?
- **Action**: What counts as "active"?

**Example - Notion:**
```
North Star: Weekly Collaborative Workspace Users

Definition:
- Weekly (time frame)
- Users who edit or view a workspace (action)
- With 2+ collaborators (segment)

Why: Collaboration = stickiness = retention = revenue
```

### Step 4: Identify Inputs (Week 2)

**Ask: "What drives the North Star?"**

**Method: Decomposition**
```
North Star = Input1 × Input2 × Input3

Example (Airbnb):
Nights Booked = Guests Searching × Listings Available × Conversion Rate × Repeat Rate
```

**Choose 3-5 key inputs:**
- Each input owned by different team
- Inputs should be leading indicators
- Inputs should be actionable

### Step 5: Build Metrics Tree (Week 3)

**Map all relevant metrics to inputs and North Star**

Use tools:
- Amplitude charts
- Google Sheets
- Miro/Figma diagrams

**Example:**
```
Revenue
  ↓
North Star: Weekly Active Users
  ↓
Inputs:
  - New user activation (20%)
  - Feature adoption (30%)
  - Retention (50%)
    ↓
Sub-metrics:
  - Onboarding completion
  - Time to value
  - Core action frequency
```

### Step 6: Socialize & Align (Week 4)

**Present to company:**
1. Why this North Star?
2. How does it tie to revenue?
3. What are the inputs?
4. How does each team contribute?

**Get buy-in:**
- Leadership alignment
- Team feedback
- Adjust based on input

### Step 7: Instrument & Track (Week 4+)

**Set up tracking:**
- Analytics platform (Amplitude, Mixpanel)
- Dashboard (visible to all)
- Weekly review cadence
- Team OKRs aligned to inputs

**Vietnamese:**

### Quy Trình 7 Bước:

1. **Xác Định Các Chỉ Số Ứng Viên**: Brainstorm khả năng
2. **Đánh Giá Theo Tiêu Chí**: Chấm điểm 1-5
3. **Định Nghĩa Chỉ Số**: Cụ thể (thời gian, đối tượng, hành động)
4. **Xác Định Inputs**: 3-5 yếu tố thúc đẩy
5. **Xây Dựng Cây Chỉ Số**: Sơ đồ inputs → NSM → Revenue
6. **Xã Hội Hóa & Liên Kết**: Present và nhận feedback
7. **Theo Dõi**: Analytics, dashboard, review

## Real Implementation Examples / Ví Dụ Triển Khai

### Example 1: Amplitude (Own Product)

**Context**: Product analytics company

**North Star**: Weekly Querying Users

**Definition**: Users who run ≥1 chart query per week

**Inputs:**
1. **Onboarding** (New user activation)
2. **Adoption** (Feature breadth)
3. **Engagement** (Query frequency)
4. **Collaboration** (Team sharing)

**Why It Works:**
- Queries = getting value from analytics
- Weekly = habit formation
- Predicts retention & expansion revenue

**Impact:**
- Teams aligned around increasing WQU
- Product decisions evaluated against NSM
- Grew from startup to IPO with this focus

### Example 2: Medium

**Evolution of North Star:**

**2013-2015: Total Time Reading**
- Problem: Clickbait articles with long read times
- Unintended consequence: Low-quality content optimized for length

**2016+: Total Contributions to Reading Time (TCR)**
- Definition: Only count reading time if user returns later
- Why: Ensures quality content (users come back)
- Result: Higher quality, better retention

**Lesson**: North Star evolves as you learn

### Example 3: Dropbox

**North Star**: Number of Files Stored

**Why Not:**
- ❌ Sign-ups (vanity metric)
- ❌ Free accounts (not sustainable)
- ❌ Referrals (means to an end)

**Why Files Stored:**
- ✅ More files = more dependency
- ✅ Predicts paid conversion
- ✅ Sustainable growth

**Inputs:**
1. New user activation (first file upload)
2. Cross-platform usage (mobile + desktop)
3. Sharing & collaboration
4. Storage growth per user

## Common Mistakes / Sai Lầm Thường Gặp

### Mistake 1: Vanity Metrics as North Star
**Problem**: Choosing sign-ups, downloads, page views
**Why Wrong**: Don't correlate with value or revenue
**Solution**: Choose metric that represents value delivered

**Examples:**
- ❌ App downloads → ✅ Weekly active users
- ❌ Sign-ups → ✅ Activated users
- ❌ Page views → ✅ Time spent / return visits

### Mistake 2: Multiple North Stars
**Problem**: "Our North Star is DAU, revenue, and satisfaction"
**Why Wrong**: Defeats purpose of single focus
**Solution**: Pick ONE. Use others as secondary metrics.

### Mistake 3: Short-term Optimization
**Problem**: North Star incentivizes harmful behavior
**Example**: Notifications increase DAU but hurt long-term retention
**Solution**:
- Add guardrail metrics
- Test long-term impact
- Balance with retention/satisfaction

### Mistake 4: Gaming the Metric
**Problem**: Teams optimize North Star in unhealthy ways
**Example**: Sending spam emails to increase DAU
**Solution**:
- Define quality thresholds
- Monitor guardrails
- Culture of integrity

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Segments
**Problem**: One North Star for all user types
**Example**: Free users vs paid users have different value actions
**Solution**:
- Define North Star per segment (if very different)
- Or weight North Star by value (e.g., paid users count 10x)

### Mistake 6: Set and Forget
**Problem**: Define North Star in 2020, never revisit
**Why Wrong**: Business evolves, metric may become stale
**Solution**:
- Review annually
- Evolve as business matures
- Okay to change if fundamentally shifts
