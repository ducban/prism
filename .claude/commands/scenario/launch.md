# Product Launch Scenario Assistant

You are helping a Product Manager plan a product launch. The user's scenario: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Step 1: Read the Core Frameworks

Access the complete GTM guide:

```
.claude/product-foundation/LAUNCH-go-to-market-strategy.md
.claude/product-foundation/VALIDATION-product-market-fit.md
```

## Step 2: Pre-Launch Checklist

**CRITICAL**: Before any GTM planning, validate PMF:
- Have you run the Sean Ellis test? (≥40% "very disappointed" = PMF)
- Is retention curve flattening? (not dropping to zero)
- Do you have organic growth? (>20% MoM)

⚠️ **WARNING**: Scaling GTM without PMF = burning money

## Step 3: Identify Launch Type

Based on the user's scenario, determine:
- **Product Stage**: New product, new feature, or new market?
- **Target Audience**: B2B or B2C? Enterprise or SMB?
- **Timeline**: How soon is the launch?
- **Resources**: Budget, team size, distribution channels

## Step 4: Build GTM Strategy (7 Parts)

Guide the user through:

### Part 1: Target Market Definition
- Define ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
- Create buyer personas
- Segment by priority

### Part 2: Value Proposition & Positioning
- Craft value prop using template
- Create positioning map vs. competitors
- Define key messages

### Part 3: Pricing Strategy
- Choose pricing model (freemium, trial, usage-based, etc.)
- Set pricing psychology tactics
- Create tier structure if applicable

### Part 4: Distribution Channels
- For B2B: Direct sales, inside sales, self-serve, or partners?
- For B2C: App stores, web, social commerce, paid ads, SEO?

### Part 5: Marketing Strategy
- Map marketing funnel (Awareness → Interest → Consideration → Purchase)
- Choose tactics per stage
- Set acquisition goals

### Part 6: Sales Strategy
- Product-Led Growth (PLG), Sales-Led, or Hybrid?
- When to use each based on ACV

### Part 7: Launch Plan
- Pre-launch (4-8 weeks): Waitlist, materials, beta, PR
- Launch week: Announce, activate, monitor
- Post-launch (1-4 weeks): Analyze, iterate, scale

## Step 5: Provide Launch Timeline

Give the user a week-by-week timeline based on their launch date:

**Weeks 1-2**: Research & Strategy
**Weeks 3-4**: Messaging & Positioning
**Weeks 5-6**: Channel & Pricing
**Weeks 7-8**: Execution Prep
**Week 9+**: Launch & Iterate

## Step 6: Quick Wins for Last-Minute Launches

If the user needs to launch SOON (< 2 weeks):
- Focus on Part 1, 2, 4, 7 only
- Use Now/Next/Later for what to skip
- Prioritize: Target → Message → Channel → Launch

## Actionable Deliverables

Provide templates for:
- [ ] ICP definition (1-pager)
- [ ] Value proposition statement
- [ ] Positioning map
- [ ] Launch channel matrix
- [ ] Launch week checklist

## Common Launch Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Boil the ocean (targeting everyone)
2. ❌ "Build it and they will come"
3. ❌ Wrong pricing (too low or too high)
4. ❌ Big bang launch without validation
5. ❌ No measurement plan
