```
INPUT: User scenario (e.g., "I'm doing a peer interview")
STEP 1: Match keywords → "interview", "peer"
STEP 2: Lookup competency → "Interviewing", "Collaboration Assessment"
STEP 3: Recommend framework → PEOPLE-interviewing-framework.md
STEP 4: Provide context → "Use peer interview section (page X)"
OUTPUT: Targeted framework guidance
```
