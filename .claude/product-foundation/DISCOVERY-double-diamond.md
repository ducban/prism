# Double Diamond Framework

## Overview

**English:**
The Double Diamond, developed by the British Design Council in 2005, is a discovery and design process framework with 4 phases: Discover (problem space), Define (which problem to solve), Develop (solutions), Deliver (final solution). Critical for stakeholder requests—prevents jumping to solutions before understanding the problem.

**Vietnamese:**
Double Diamond, phát triển bởi British Design Council năm 2005, là framework quy trình khám phá và thiết kế với 4 giai đoạn: Khám phá (không gian vấn đề), Xác định (vấn đề nào cần giải quyết), Phát triển (giải pháp), Chuyển giao (giải pháp cuối cùng). Quan trọng cho yêu cầu stakeholder—tránh nhảy vào giải pháp trước khi hiểu vấn đề.

---

## When to Use It

**English:**
- Stakeholder requests a specific solution without context
- Unclear or complex problem that needs exploration
- Need to align team on WHAT problem to solve before HOW
- Early stage feature discovery

**Vietnamese:**
- Stakeholder yêu cầu giải pháp cụ thể không có ngữ cảnh
- Vấn đề không rõ ràng hoặc phức tạp cần khám phá
- Cần căn chỉnh team về vấn đề CẦN giải quyết trước KHI giải quyết
- Giai đoạn đầu khám phá tính năng

---

```

**Diamond 1: Problem Space (Discover + Define)**
- **Discover** (Diverge): Explore broadly to understand the problem space
- **Define** (Converge): Narrow down to THE problem to solve

**Diamond 2: Solution Space (Develop + Deliver)**
- **Develop** (Diverge): Generate multiple solution ideas
- **Deliver** (Converge): Build and ship final solution

---

## Phase 1: DISCOVER (Divergent Thinking)

### Goal
Understand the problem space broadly. Don't assume you know the problem yet!

### Activities
- User interviews (10-15 people)
- Observational research (shadow users)
- Stakeholder interviews (understand their perspective)
- Competitive analysis (how do others solve this?)
- Data analysis (what metrics show problems?)
- Support ticket review (what do users complain about?)

### Key Questions
- "What problems do users experience?"
- "Why does this problem exist?"
- "Who is affected by this problem?"
- "When does this problem occur?"
- "What have they tried before?"

### Example: CEO requests "Add AI section to homepage"

**Discover Activities** (Week 1-2):
- Interviewed 10 lost prospects
- Interviewed 5 won customers
- Interviewed sales team (5 people)
- Analyzed competitor homepages (10 companies)
- Reviewed sales call recordings (20 calls)
- Analyzed drop-off data from website analytics

**Findings** (Divergent - many problems found):
1. "I don't know what makes you different from competitors"
2. "Your homepage doesn't explain what you do"
3. "I need technical docs for legal team"
4. "Boss doesn't believe AI is real"
5. "Pricing is hidden, makes me suspicious"
6. "No case studies from companies like mine"
7. "Trial signup asks for too much info"

---

## Phase 2: DEFINE (Convergent Thinking)

### Goal
Of all the problems found, which ONE is most critical to solve?

### Activities
- Synthesize research findings
- Identify patterns and themes
- Prioritize problems by impact
- Create problem statement
- Get stakeholder alignment on THE problem

### Prioritization Matrix

| Problem | Frequency | Impact | Solvability | Priority Score |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| "Don't know what makes you different" | High (80%) | High | Medium | **HIGH** |
| "Need technical docs for legal" | Medium (40%) | Medium | High | MEDIUM |
| "Don't explain what you do" | Low (20%) | High | High | MEDIUM |
| "Pricing is hidden" | Low (15%) | Low | High | LOW |

### Result: Define THE Problem

**Problem Statement:**
"Enterprise buyers evaluating our product cannot articulate to their leadership how we're different from competitors, causing 60% of trials to end without conversion."

**Not**: "We need an AI section on homepage" (That's a solution!)
**Yes**: "Buyers can't differentiate us from competitors" (That's the problem!)

---

## Phase 3: DEVELOP (Divergent Thinking)

### Goal
Generate multiple solution ideas. Don't commit to one yet!

### Activities
- Ideation sessions (brainstorm 20+ ideas)
- Sketching/wireframing multiple concepts
- Look at analogous problems (how do other industries solve this?)
- Prototype low-fidelity versions
- Quick user testing of prototypes

### Solution Ideas
(for "Buyers can't differentiate us from competitors"):

1. AI section on homepage
2. Comparison chart vs. top 3 competitors
3. Interactive demo showing AI capabilities
4. Case study page with industry-specific stories
5. "Battle card" PDF for champions to share internally
6. Video: "Why we're different in 90 seconds"
7. Technical architecture documentation
8. ROI calculator showing AI-powered time savings
9. Live chat with sales engineer during trial
10. Automated competitive analysis tool

### Evaluation Criteria
- Impact on differentiation (high/medium/low)
- Effort to build (weeks)
- Time to value (how fast can we test?)

### Rapid Prototyping (Week 3-4)

Build 3-5 low-fidelity prototypes and test with 5-10 users each:

| Solution | Prototype | Test Result |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| AI section on homepage | Mockup in Figma | 2/10 users: "Now I understand difference" (20%) |
| Comparison chart | Google Doc table | 7/10 users: "This is exactly what I needed!" (70%) |
| Interactive demo | Loom video walkthrough | 6/10 users: "Showed me AI is real" (60%) |
| Battle card PDF | 1-page PDF | 8/10 users: "Perfect for sharing with boss" (80%) |

---

## Phase 4: DELIVER (Convergent Thinking)

### Goal
Build and ship the best solution(s).

### Activities
- Select 1-3 solutions based on test results
- Build production-ready versions
- QA and polish
- Launch and measure
- Iterate based on feedback

### Decision (based on test results)

**Phase 1 Launch** (Week 5-6): Ship top 2 solutions
1. **Battle card PDF** (80% positive response, 3 days to build)
2. **Comparison chart** (70% positive response, 1 week to build)

**Phase 2 Launch** (Week 8-10):
3. **Interactive demo** (60% positive response, 2 weeks to build)

**Deprioritized**:
- AI section on homepage (only 20% found it helpful)

### Result
- CEO's requested solution (AI section) scored lowest in testing
- Data-driven alternative solutions had 3-4X better results
- Shipped in 6 weeks instead of jumping to wrong solution

---

## Complete Example: CEO Request Process

### The Request
**CEO Request**: "Add AI section to homepage"

---

### Traditional Approach (No Double Diamond)

1. CEO says "Add AI section"
2. PM creates requirements
3. Design mocks up AI section
4. Engineering builds it (6 weeks)
5. Launch
6. **Result**: 0% improvement in conversions. Why?

**Problem**: Started with a solution instead of understanding the problem.

---

### Double Diamond Approach

#### Phase 1: DISCOVER (2 weeks)

Don't build anything yet. First understand the problem space.

**PM to CEO**: "What problem are we trying to solve with the AI section?"
**CEO**: "We're losing deals. Prospects don't understand we're AI-powered."

**Research Questions:**
- Why are we losing deals?
- What do prospects not understand?
- Where do they drop off?
- What info are they looking for?

**Research Methods:**
- Win/Loss analysis (interview 10 lost prospects, 10 won customers)
- Sales team interviews (5 reps)
- Website analytics (heatmaps, drop-off points)
- Competitor analysis (how do they position AI?)

**Findings** (many problems uncovered):
1. 60% of prospects: "Can't explain to my boss why you're different"
2. 40% of prospects: "Legal team needs technical AI documentation"
3. 30% of prospects: "Don't believe AI claims are real"
4. 20% of prospects: "Homepage doesn't clearly explain what you do"

---

#### Phase 2: DEFINE (3 days)

Narrow down to THE problem.

**Analysis**:
| Problem | % Affected | Deal Impact | Priority |
|---------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Can't articulate differentiation | 60% | High (blocker) | **#1** |
| Legal needs docs | 40% | Medium (slows deal) | #2 |
| Don't believe AI claims | 30% | Medium | #3 |
| Homepage unclear | 20% | Low | #4 |

**Defined Problem Statement:**
"60% of prospects who reach trial stage cannot articulate to their leadership why we're different from competitors, causing deals to stall or fail."

**Insight**: CEO's assumption was "they don't know we have AI." Reality: "They know we have AI, but can't explain WHY OURS IS BETTER."

---

#### Phase 3: DEVELOP (2 weeks)

Generate multiple solutions and prototype.

**Ideation Session**: Generated 12 solution ideas

**Top 5 to Prototype:**
1. Comparison chart (us vs. competitors)
2. "Champion's toolkit" - PDF with talking points
3. AI section on homepage (CEO's idea)
4. ROI calculator showing AI benefits
5. Recorded customer testimonial video

**Rapid Prototyping**:
- Created Figma mockups
- Built PDF samples
- Recorded prototype video
- Tested with 10 prospects

**Results:**
| Solution | User Response | "Would this help close your deal?" |
|----------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| Champion's toolkit PDF | "This is gold!" | 8/10 said YES (80%) |
| Comparison chart | "Exactly what I needed" | 7/10 said YES (70%) |
| ROI calculator | "Would use this" | 6/10 said YES (60%) |
| AI homepage section | "Interesting but..." | 2/10 said YES (20%) |
| Customer video | "Nice to have" | 4/10 said YES (40%) |

---

#### Phase 4: DELIVER (3 weeks)

Build and ship the winners.

**Decision:**
1. **Week 1**: Ship Champion's Toolkit PDF (3 days to create)
2. **Week 2**: Ship Comparison Chart page (1 week to build)
3. **Week 3-4**: Ship ROI Calculator (2 weeks to build)

**Not shipping**: AI homepage section (scored worst in tests)

**Measuring Success:**
- Metric: % of trials that convert to paid
- Before: 15% conversion
- After (30 days): 28% conversion
- **Result: 87% improvement**

---

### Presentation to CEO (4 weeks after request)

"CEO, you requested an AI section on homepage 4 weeks ago. Here's what we did differently:

**We used the Double Diamond process:**
1. **Discovered** the real problem (not what we assumed)
2. **Defined** the core issue (can't articulate differentiation)
3. **Developed** multiple solutions (not just your idea)
4. **Delivered** the 3 best solutions (based on user testing)

**Result:**
- Your idea (AI section): 20% user validation
- Our data-driven approach: 70-80% user validation
- **Conversions increased 87%** vs. estimated 0% if we built AI section

**What we shipped:**
1. Champion's toolkit (80% validated)
2. Comparison chart (70% validated)
3. ROI calculator (60% validated)

**We didn't ship:**
- AI homepage section (20% validated)

**Key insight**: The problem wasn't "they don't know we have AI." It was "they can't explain why our AI is better." Different problem = different solution."

**CEO Response**: "This is exactly the strategic thinking I want. Great work."

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Better Approach |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Skipping Discover phase** | Jump to solutions without understanding problem | Always start with research |
| **Only talking to stakeholders** | Miss the real user problems | Interview actual users (10-15 people) |
| **Defining problem as a solution** | "Problem: We need a dashboard" (that's a solution!) | "Problem: Users can't see progress" (actual problem) |
| **Generating only 1-2 solutions** | Miss better alternatives | Generate 10+ ideas, prototype 3-5 |
| **No prototype testing** | Build wrong solution for 2 months | Test lo-fi prototypes in 2 days |

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Divergent vs. Convergent Thinking

**Divergent Thinking** (Diamond widens):
- Goal: Generate many possibilities
- Mindset: "Yes, and..." not "Yes, but..."
- Activities: Brainstorming, research, exploration
- Output: Long list of options

**Convergent Thinking** (Diamond narrows):
- Goal: Select the best option
- Mindset: Critical evaluation, prioritization
- Activities: Analysis, testing, decision-making
- Output: Single clear direction

### 2. Problem-First, Not Solution-First

**Wrong approach:**
- Stakeholder: "Build feature X"
- PM: "OK, here are the requirements for X"

**Right approach:**
- Stakeholder: "Build feature X"
- PM: "What problem does X solve? Let's explore that first"

### 3. Test Before Building

**Traditional:**
- Build full solution (6 weeks)
- Launch
- Discover it doesn't work
- Wasted 6 weeks

**Double Diamond:**
- Prototype 3-5 solutions (3 days)
- Test with users
- Build only the winner (2 weeks)
- Ship with confidence

## Vietnamese Summary

### Tóm Tắt

Double Diamond có 4 giai đoạn:

1. **Discover (Khám phá)**: Mở rộng - tìm hiểu nhiều vấn đề
   - Phỏng vấn người dùng 10-15 người
   - Phân tích dữ liệu, đối thủ, support tickets
   - Mục tiêu: Hiểu toàn bộ không gian vấn đề

2. **Define (Xác định)**: Thu hẹp - chọn vấn đề chính cần giải quyết
   - Tổng hợp findings từ Discover
   - Ưu tiên vấn đề theo tác động
   - Tạo problem statement rõ ràng

3. **Develop (Phát triển)**: Mở rộng - tạo nhiều giải pháp
   - Brainstorm 10+ ý tưởng
   - Prototype 3-5 giải pháp tốt nhất
   - Test với người dùng để chọn winner

4. **Deliver (Chuyển giao)**: Thu hẹp - xây dựng giải pháp tốt nhất
   - Build giải pháp đã được validate
   - Launch và đo lường kết quả
   - Iterate dựa trên feedback

### Lợi Ích Chính

- **Tránh xây dựng giải pháp sai**: Hiểu vấn đề trước khi build
- **Tiết kiệm thời gian**: Test prototype trong 3 ngày thay vì build sai 6 tuần
- **Tăng tỷ lệ thành công**: Giải pháp được validate bởi user trước khi build
- **Alignment tốt hơn**: Tất cả stakeholders đồng ý về vấn đề cần giải quyết

### Sai Lầm Thường Gặp

1. **Bỏ qua Discover**: Nhảy thẳng vào giải pháp mà không hiểu vấn đề
2. **Chỉ nói với stakeholders**: Bỏ lỡ vấn đề thực của user
3. **Định nghĩa vấn đề là giải pháp**: "Vấn đề: Cần dashboard" (đó là giải pháp!)
4. **Chỉ tạo 1-2 giải pháp**: Bỏ lỡ alternatives tốt hơn
5. **Không test prototype**: Build sai giải pháp trong 2 tháng

### Khi Nào Dùng

- Stakeholder yêu cầu giải pháp cụ thể không có context
- Vấn đề không rõ ràng hoặc phức tạp
- Cần align team về vấn đề CẦN giải quyết trước KHI giải quyết
- Giai đoạn đầu feature discovery

## Conclusion

The Double Diamond Framework is essential for product managers who want to:
- Build the RIGHT thing (not just build things right)
- Validate before investing significant resources
- Align stakeholders on problem and solution
- Increase success rate of launched features

**Key takeaway**: Spend time understanding the problem (first diamond) before jumping to solutions (second diamond). The best solution to the wrong problem is still a failure.

**Remember**: When a stakeholder requests a specific solution, your job is to understand the problem first. Double Diamond gives you the structure and confidence to say: "Great idea! Let's first understand what problem we're solving, then explore if this is the best solution."
