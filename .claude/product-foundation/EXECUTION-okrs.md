# OKRs (Objectives & Key Results) / OKRs (Mục Tiêu & Kết Quả Chính)

## Overview / Tổng Quan

**English:**
OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) is a goal-setting framework used by Google, Intel, LinkedIn, Twitter, and thousands of companies to set ambitious goals and track outcomes.

**OKR Structure:**
```
Objective: WHAT you want to achieve (qualitative, inspirational)
  ↓
Key Results: HOW you'll measure success (quantitative, time-bound)
  ↓
Initiatives: WHAT you'll do to achieve key results (optional)
```

**Example - YouTube (2012):**
```
Objective: Reach 1 billion hours of watch time per day

Key Results:
  KR1: Increase daily watch time from 100M to 1B hours
  KR2: Grow number of channels with >10K subscribers from 10K to 100K
  KR3: Improve viewer satisfaction score from 7.0 to 8.5

Result: Achieved in 2016 (4 years)
Impact: Transformed YouTube from views-focused to watch-time-focused
```

**Why OKRs Matter:**
- **Alignment**: Everyone knows company priorities
- **Focus**: Limit to 3-5 OKRs prevents spreading thin
- **Transparency**: Public OKRs create accountability
- **Ambitious**: "Moonshot" goals drive innovation
- **Measurable**: Objective tracking, not subjective opinions

**Vietnamese:**
OKRs là khung đặt mục tiêu được sử dụng bởi Google, Intel, LinkedIn để đặt mục tiêu đầy tham vọng và theo dõi kết quả.

**Cấu Trúc OKR:**
- **Objective** (Mục tiêu): CÁI GÌ bạn muốn đạt được
- **Key Results** (Kết quả chính): CÁCH NÀO đo lường thành công
- **Initiatives** (Sáng kiến): LÀM GÌ để đạt key results

**Ví Dụ - YouTube (2012):**
- **Mục tiêu**: Đạt 1 tỷ giờ xem/ngày
- **KR1**: Tăng từ 100M lên 1B giờ xem/ngày
- **KR2**: Tăng kênh >10K subscribers từ 10K lên 100K
- **KR3**: Cải thiện điểm hài lòng từ 7.0 lên 8.5
- **Kết quả**: Đạt được năm 2016

## The OKR Framework / Khung OKR

**English:**

### Anatomy of Good OKRs

**OBJECTIVE (The "What")**
- Qualitative and inspirational
- Time-bound (quarterly or annually)
- Action-oriented
- Memorable and motivating

**Good Objectives:**
- ✅ "Become the #1 productivity app for remote teams"
- ✅ "Delight customers with lightning-fast support"
- ✅ "Build the most developer-friendly API"

**Bad Objectives:**
- ❌ "Increase revenue" (not inspiring, no context)
- ❌ "Improve product quality" (vague, not memorable)
- ❌ "Launch 5 features" (outputs, not outcomes)

**KEY RESULTS (The "How to Measure")**
- Quantitative and measurable
- Specific number or percentage
- Time-bound (end of quarter/year)
- Ambitious but achievable

**Good Key Results:**
- ✅ "Increase NPS from 30 to 50"
- ✅ "Reduce page load time from 3s to 1s"
- ✅ "Grow DAU from 10K to 50K"
- ✅ "Achieve 95% on-time delivery rate"

**Bad Key Results:**
- ❌ "Improve user experience" (not measurable)
- ❌ "Launch mobile app" (output, not outcome)
- ❌ "Increase users" (no specific number)
- ❌ "Do better than last quarter" (vague)

### OKR Best Practices

**1. Limit to 3-5 OKRs per level**
- Company: 3-5 OKRs
- Team: 3-5 OKRs (aligned to company)
- Individual: 3-5 OKRs (aligned to team)

**2. Each Objective has 2-5 Key Results**
- Too few KRs: Not comprehensive
- Too many KRs: Lack of focus

**3. 70% Achievement is Success**
- If you hit 100%, goals weren't ambitious enough
- 60-70% = Good performance
- 40-60% = Learning opportunity
- <40% = Rethink approach

**4. Mix Committed & Aspirational OKRs**
- **Committed**: Must achieve (90-100% expected)
- **Aspirational**: Stretch goals (60-70% expected)

**Vietnamese:**

### Cấu Trúc OKR Tốt:

**OBJECTIVE:**
- Định tính, truyền cảm hứng
- Giới hạn thời gian
- Hành động
- Dễ nhớ, động lực

**KEY RESULTS:**
- Định lượng, đo được
- Số cụ thể
- Giới hạn thời gian
- Đầy tham vọng nhưng đạt được

**Thực Hành Tốt:**
1. Giới hạn 3-5 OKRs mỗi cấp
2. Mỗi Objective có 2-5 Key Results
3. Đạt 70% là thành công
4. Kết hợp Committed & Aspirational

5. Present to entire company (transparency)

**Step 2: Team OKRs (Team Leads)**
1. Review company OKRs
2. Identify how team contributes
3. Draft team OKRs (aligned but not cascaded)
4. Ensure 60% aligned to company, 40% team-specific
5. Share with other teams (cross-functional alignment)

**Step 3: Individual OKRs (Contributors)**

3. Draft 3-5 OKRs (mix of team + personal growth)
4. Discuss with manager
5. Finalize and publish

**Timeline:**

### Phase 2: Execution (Weeks 3-12 of Quarter)

**Step 4: Weekly Check-ins**
- Review progress on Key Results
- Update percentage completion
- Identify blockers
- Adjust initiatives if needed

**Step 5: Monthly Reviews**
- Formal review with team
- Traffic light status: 🟢 On track, 🟡 At risk, 🔴 Off track
- Discuss learnings

### Phase 3: Grading (Week 13, End of Quarter)

**Step 7: Grade Each Key Result**
- Assign score: 0.0 to 1.0
- 0.0 = No progress
- 0.3 = Made progress, far from target
- 0.5 = Halfway there
- 0.7 = Success (for aspirational OKRs)
- 1.0 = Exceeded (for committed OKRs)

**Step 8: Objective Scoring**
- Average of Key Result scores
- 0.6-0.7 = Good performance
- 0.8-1.0 = Either too easy or exceptional execution

**Step 9: Reflection**
- What worked? What didn't?
- What did we learn?
- What should we do differently next quarter?

### Phase 4: Next Quarter Planning

## Common Mistakes / Sai Lầm Thường Gặp

### Mistake 1: Sandbagging (Setting Easy Goals)
**Problem**: Setting goals you know you'll hit 100%
**Why It's Wrong**: No stretch, no innovation
**Solution**:
- Aim for 60-70% achievement
- Make OKRs aspirational
- Create psychological safety (failure is learning)

### Mistake 2: Waterfall Cascading
**Problem**: Every team OKR must map to company OKR
**Why It's Wrong**: Limits team autonomy, stifles innovation
**Solution**:
- 60% aligned to company priorities
- 40% team-specific innovation
- Allow bottom-up OKRs

### Mistake 3: Business as Usual
**Problem**: OKRs are just regular work, no stretch
**Example**: "Ship features on roadmap" (you'd do anyway)
**Solution**:
- OKRs should be extra push beyond BAU
- Separate "BAU" from "OKR work"

### Mistake 4: Too Many OKRs
**Problem**: 10 objectives, 50 key results
**Why It's Wrong**: No focus, everything is priority
**Solution**:
- Maximum 5 objectives
- 2-5 key results each
- If everything is important, nothing is

### Mistake 5: Output-Based KRs
**Problem**: "Launch mobile app", "Hire 5 engineers"
**Why It's Wrong**: Measures activity, not outcomes
**Solution**:
- Focus on impact: "Reach 100K mobile users"
- Focus on value: "Reduce time-to-hire from 60 to 30 days"

### Mistake 6: No Mid-Quarter Adjustments
**Problem**: Set OKRs in stone, never revisit
**Why It's Wrong**: Market changes, priorities shift
**Solution**:
- Weekly check-ins
- Monthly reviews
- Okay to adjust if fundamentally changed

### Mistake 7: Tying OKRs to Compensation
**Problem**: Bonus based on OKR achievement
**Why It's Wrong**: Incentivizes sandbagging
**Solution**:
- Decouple OKRs from performance reviews
- Use OKRs for alignment, not compensation
- Reward effort and learning, not just results
