# Stakeholder Management Framework / Khung Quản Lý Các Bên Liên Quan

## Overview / Tổng Quan

**English:**
Stakeholder management is the art of identifying, analyzing, and influencing the people who can impact your project's success. As a PM, you have responsibility without authority—you must get buy-in without direct control.

**Why Stakeholder Management Matters:**
- **Project Success**: 70% of failed projects cite poor stakeholder management (PMI)
- **Speed**: Good stakeholder management accelerates decisions by 3x
- **Resources**: Stakeholders control budget, headcount, and priorities
- **Career**: Your ability to influence stakeholders determines your impact

**The PM's Challenge:**
- Engineering wants technical excellence
- Design wants perfect UX
- Sales wants features yesterday
- Leadership wants business impact
- You want to ship something valuable

**Your job**: Align these competing interests toward a common goal.

**Real Example - Airbnb's "Snow White" Project (2012):**
**Context**: Brian Chesky (CEO) wanted to redesign the entire product
**Stakeholders**:
- Engineering: "This will take 2 years and break everything"
- Design: "Finally, we can do it right!"
- Growth: "Don't touch what's working"
- Sales/CS: "Our customers will be confused"

**Joe Gebbia's (Co-founder) Approach**:
1. **Mapped stakeholders**: Created power/interest grid
2. **Managed each group differently**:
   - Engineering: Phased rollout, A/B tested (reduced risk)
   - Growth: Data-driven (showed +30% conversion in tests)
   - Sales: Early access, training, FAQ docs
   - CEO (high power): Weekly demos, clear milestones
3. **Result**: Launched in 6 months, +25% bookings, became Airbnb's growth inflection point

**Vietnamese:**
Quản lý các bên liên quan là nghệ thuật xác định, phân tích và ảnh hưởng những người có thể tác động đến thành công dự án. Là PM, bạn có trách nhiệm nhưng không có quyền lực—phải thuyết phục mà không kiểm soát trực tiếp.

**Tại Sao Quan Trọng:**
- 70% dự án thất bại do quản lý stakeholder kém
- Quản lý tốt tăng tốc quyết định gấp 3 lần
- Stakeholder kiểm soát ngân sách, nhân lực, ưu tiên

**Thách Thức PM:**
- Engineering muốn kỹ thuật hoàn hảo
- Design muốn UX hoàn hảo
- Sales muốn tính năng ngay
- Leadership muốn tác động kinh doanh
- Bạn muốn ship thứ gì đó có giá trị

**Công việc của bạn**: Căn chỉnh những lợi ích cạnh tranh này.

## The Power/Interest Grid / Lưới Quyền Lực/Quan Tâm

**English:**

The Mendelow Matrix (1981) is the foundational tool for stakeholder analysis.

## Stakeholder Mapping Playbook / Sách Hướng Dẫn Lập Bản Đồ

**English:**

### Step 1: Identify Stakeholders

**Brainstorm all stakeholders:**
- [ ] Direct manager
- [ ] Skip-level (manager's manager)
- [ ] Executive sponsor
- [ ] Engineering team
- [ ] Design team
- [ ] Data/Analytics
- [ ] Marketing
- [ ] Sales
- [ ] Customer Success
- [ ] Legal/Compliance
- [ ] Finance
- [ ] End users
- [ ] Other PMs
- [ ] Partners/3rd parties

**Pro Tip**: Ask yourself "Who can say no to this project?" and "Who will be affected by this?"

### Step 2: Assess Each Stakeholder

For each stakeholder, rate:

**Power (1-10)**:
- Can they approve/reject?
- Do they control resources (budget, people)?
- Do they have executive ear?
- Can they block progress?

**Interest (1-10)**:
- How much do they care about this project?
- Is it their priority or one of many?
- Will they be directly impacted?

**Support Level**:
- 🟢 **Champion**: Actively supporting
- 🟡 **Neutral**: Not opposing, not helping
- 🔴 **Blocker**: Actively resisting
- ⚪ **Unknown**: Need to assess

**Influence Style**:
- **Analytical**: Wants data, ROI, metrics
- **Driver**: Wants speed, decisions, action
- **Expressive**: Wants vision, innovation, storytelling
- **Amiable**: Wants consensus, harmony, relationships

### Step 3: Plot on Grid

**Example: E-commerce Checkout Redesign**

```
High Power
    ↑
    │
    │  [CFO - 8,3]           [VP Product - 10,10]
    │  "Keep Satisfied"      "Manage Closely"
    │
    │  [CEO - 9,5]            [Director Eng - 8,9]
    │  "Keep Satisfied"      "Manage Closely"
    │
    │
    ├──────────────────────────────────────────→ High Interest
    │
    │  [Legal - 2,2]         [Sr PM - 4,8]
    │  "Monitor"             "Keep Informed"
    │
    │  [Marketing - 3,3]     [Power Users - 2,9]
    │  "Monitor"             "Keep Informed"
    │
    ↓
Low Power
```

**Analysis**:
- **VP Product (10,10)**: Weekly 1-on-1s, involve in decisions
- **Director Eng (8,9)**: Partner closely, daily standups
- **CEO (9,5)**: Monthly updates, demo at key milestones
- **CFO (8,3)**: Budget approved, quarterly updates
- **Sr PM (4,8)**: Keep in loop, leverage their experience
- **Power Users (2,9)**: Beta testers, feedback group

### Step 4: Create Engagement Plan

For each quadrant, define:

**"Manage Closely" Stakeholders:**
| Name | Power | Interest | Current Support | Communication Plan | Key Messages |
|------|-------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| VP Product | 10 | 10 | Champion | Weekly 1-on-1, Slack | Progress, blockers, decisions needed |
| Director Eng | 8 | 9 | Neutral→Champion | Bi-weekly sync, standups | Technical approach, timeline, risks |

**"Keep Satisfied" Stakeholders:**
| Name | Power | Interest | Current Support | Communication Plan | Key Messages |
|------|-------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| CEO | 9 | 5 | Neutral | Monthly demo | Business impact, metrics, strategic alignment |
| CFO | 8 | 3 | Neutral | Quarterly update | ROI, budget tracking, resource efficiency |

**"Keep Informed" Stakeholders:**
| Name | Power | Interest | Current Support | Communication Plan | Key Messages |
|------|-------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Sr PM | 4 | 8 | Champion | Weekly email | Feature details, launch plan, how to contribute |
| Power Users | 2 | 9 | Champion | Beta program, feedback sessions | New features, how to test, impact on workflow |

### Step 5: Build Relationships

**For each key stakeholder:**

**1. Understand Their Perspective**
- What are their goals? (OKRs, priorities)
- What do they care about? (Metrics, reputation, team)
- What are their concerns? (Risks, costs, timeline)
- What's their communication style?

**2. Find Alignment**
- How does your project help them?
- What's the win-win?
- Where do interests overlap?

**3. Address Concerns Proactively**
- What are their objections?
- How can you mitigate risks?
- What would make them supporters?

**Example: Converting a Blocker**

**Situation**: CFO is blocking your project (concerned about $500K budget)

**Old Approach**: ❌
- "We really need this budget"
- "Other companies are doing this"
- "Trust me, it'll work"

**Stakeholder Management Approach**: ✅

**Step 1 - Understand**:
- Schedule 1-on-1: "I want to understand your concerns about the budget"
- Listen: CFO is worried about Q4 cash flow
- Empathize: "I understand, cash flow is tight"

**Step 2 - Reframe**:
- Speak their language: "Let me show you the ROI model"
- Address concern: "We can phase spending: $100K now, $400K in Q1"
- Show data: "Pilot shows 3x ROAS, 12-month payback"

**Step 3 - Find Compromise**:
- "What if we start with $100K pilot, scale if it hits targets?"
- CFO feels in control, you get to prove value

**Result**: CFO moves from 🔴 Blocker → 🟡 Neutral → 🟢 Champion (when pilot succeeds)

**Vietnamese:**

### Quy Trình 5 Bước:

**Bước 1**: Xác định stakeholders
**Bước 2**: Đánh giá mỗi stakeholder (Power, Interest, Support, Style)
**Bước 3**: Vẽ trên lưới
**Bước 4**: Tạo kế hoạch engagement
**Bước 5**: Xây dựng mối quan hệ

## Managing Up: Working with Leadership / Quản Lý Lên

**English:**

"Managing up" is influencing your manager and leadership effectively.

### The HBR Model (Gabarro & Kotter, 1980)

**1. Understand Your Boss**

**Their Goals**:
- What are they trying to achieve? (OKRs, promotion criteria)
- What does their boss care about?
- What's their reputation risk?

**Their Pressures**:
- What keeps them up at night?
- Where are they getting heat from above?
- What are their constraints?

**Their Style**:
- **Reader** vs **Listener**: Doc vs verbal update?
- **Detail** vs **Big Picture**: Exec summary vs deep-dive?
- **Frequency**: Daily check-ins vs weekly sync?
- **Decision Style**: Data-driven vs intuition?

**Example**:
- **Boss A** (Reader, Big Picture, Weekly): Send Friday email with 3-bullet update
- **Boss B** (Listener, Detail, Daily): Quick 10-min standup every morning

**2. Adapt Your Communication**

**For Analytical Leaders** (Want data):
```
Subject: Q3 Product Update - On Track, 2 Risks

Summary:
• Launch on track for Sept 15 (95% confidence)
• Beta NPS: 65 (target: 50+) ✅
• Risk: API dependency delayed 2 weeks ⚠️

Metrics:
[Chart showing progress]

Ask: Approve $50K for backup API vendor?
```

**For Visionary Leaders** (Want big picture):
```
Subject: We're Building the Future of X

The Vision:
Right now, customers spend 10 hours/week on [pain]. We're
building a solution that reduces this to 30 minutes.

The Impact:
If we nail this, we'll 10x the market and own the category.

The Ask:
I need 2 more engineers to hit our window of opportunity.
```

**For Driver Leaders** (Want action):
```
Subject: Decision Needed: API Vendor

Situation: Current vendor delayed 2 weeks
Options:
  A) Wait (risk: miss launch) ❌
  B) Switch vendor (+$50K, on time) ✅
  C) Build in-house (+4 weeks) ❌

Recommendation: Option B

Approve? [Yes/No]
```

**3. No Surprises**

**The Golden Rule**: Never let your boss be surprised in a meeting with their boss.

**Bad**:
- VP asks your boss in staff meeting: "How's Project X?"
- Your boss: "Uh... I think it's going well?"
- VP: "You don't know?!"

**Good**:
- You send Friday update: "Project X is 2 weeks delayed due to API issue. Mitigation plan: switching vendors."
- Your boss in staff meeting: "Project X is on track. We had an API delay but switching vendors, still hitting launch date."
- VP: "Great, thanks for staying on top of it."

**4. Bring Solutions, Not Just Problems**

**Bad**:
- "The API is broken. What should we do?"

**Good**:
- "The API is broken. I've evaluated 3 alternatives. My recommendation is Vendor B ($50K, 1-week integration). Can I proceed?"

**Your boss wants**:
- To know about problems early
- To see you've thought it through
- To make decisions, not solve problems for you

**5. Make Them Look Good**

**How**:
- Credit them in meetings ("As Sarah suggested...")
- Prepare them for exec presentations
- Handle fires before they escalate
- Make their life easier

**Example - Facebook PM**:
Mark Zuckerberg asked a PM in a meeting: "What's the status of feature X?"

**Option A** (Bad):
PM: "Uh, let me check..." (Mark annoyed)

**Option B** (Good):
PM's manager: "We're on track for Q2 launch. I'll send you the full update after this meeting." (Mark satisfied)

**Behind the scenes**: PM sent their manager a weekly update email that manager forwarded to Mark's EA for CEO briefing doc.

**Result**: PM made manager look informed, manager made Mark feel in control.

**Vietnamese:**

### Quản Lý Lên (HBR Model):

**1. Hiểu sếp của bạn**:
- Mục tiêu, áp lực, phong cách

**2. Điều chỉnh giao tiếp**:
- Analytical: Dữ liệu
- Visionary: Tầm nhìn
- Driver: Hành động

**3. Không bất ngờ**:
- Quy tắc vàng: Đừng để sếp ngạc nhiên

**4. Mang giải pháp, không chỉ vấn đề**

**5. Làm họ trông tốt**

## Influence Strategies / Chiến Lược Ảnh Hưởng

**English:**

### The Six Principles of Influence (Cialdini)

**1. Reciprocity**
- **Principle**: People feel obligated to give back
- **Application**: Help stakeholders first, ask later
- **Example**: Help Sales close a deal → They support your feature request

**2. Commitment & Consistency**
- **Principle**: People want to be consistent with past actions
- **Application**: Get small "yes" first, build to big "yes"
- **Example**:
  - Week 1: "Do you agree we should improve conversion?" (Yes)
  - Week 2: "Should we test this hypothesis?" (Yes)
  - Week 3: "Can we allocate budget to build winner?" (Yes - they've committed)

**3. Social Proof**
- **Principle**: People follow others' lead
- **Application**: "Other teams are doing this"
- **Example**: "Google, Netflix, and Stripe all use this approach. Our competitor just launched it."

**4. Authority**
- **Principle**: People defer to experts
- **Application**: Leverage data, research, credentials
- **Example**: "According to Gartner research..." or "Our data scientist analyzed..."

**5. Liking**
- **Principle**: People say yes to those they like
- **Application**: Build genuine relationships
- **Example**: Coffee chats, learn about their goals, find common ground

**6. Scarcity**
- **Principle**: People want what's limited
- **Application**: Create urgency
- **Example**: "Competitor is launching in 3 months" or "Market window closes Q4"

### Stakeholder-Specific Tactics

**For Engineering Leaders**:
- ✅ Show technical trade-offs
- ✅ Respect engineering judgment
- ✅ Involve them early in design
- ✅ Acknowledge technical debt
- ❌ Don't promise features without consulting them

**For Design Leaders**:
- ✅ Share user research
- ✅ Invite to user interviews
- ✅ Respect UX principles
- ✅ Give time for quality
- ❌ Don't skip design review

**For Sales Leaders**:
- ✅ Show revenue impact
- ✅ Make them heroes to customers
- ✅ Give them early access
- ✅ Create demo-ready features
- ❌ Don't over-promise timelines

**For Finance Leaders**:
- ✅ Speak in ROI, payback, NPV
- ✅ Show budget discipline
- ✅ Tie to revenue/cost savings
- ✅ Quantify everything
- ❌ Don't ask for money without business case

**Vietnamese:**

### 6 Nguyên Tắc Ảnh Hưởng (Cialdini):

**1. Có đi có lại**: Giúp đỡ trước, yêu cầu sau
**2. Cam kết & Nhất quán**: Có "yes" nhỏ, xây dựng đến "yes" lớn
**3. Bằng chứng xã hội**: "Người khác đang làm điều này"
**4. Thẩm quyền**: Tận dụng dữ liệu, nghiên cứu
**5. Thích**: Xây dựng mối quan hệ thực sự
**6. khan hiếm**: Tạo sự khẩn cấp

## Common Mistakes / Sai Lầm Thường Gặp

### Mistake 1: One-Size-Fits-All Communication
**Problem**: Same update to CEO and IC engineer

**Why It Fails**:
- CEO wants business impact
- Engineer wants technical details
- Both feel message isn't relevant

**Solution**: Tailor message to audience. CEO gets exec summary, engineer gets technical spec.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Low-Power Stakeholders
**Problem**: Only manage VPs, ignore ICs

**Why It Fails**:
- ICs do the actual work
- They can slow-walk projects
- They become future leaders

**Solution**: Build relationships across levels.

### Mistake 3: Surprising Leadership
**Problem**: Bad news comes up in exec meeting

**Why It Fails**:
- Boss looks uninformed
- Trust erodes
- You lose autonomy

**Solution**: Weekly email updates. Flag risks early.

### Mistake 4: Not Mapping Stakeholders
**Problem**: "I'll just figure it out as I go"

**Why It Fails**:
- Miss key stakeholders
- Wrong communication strategy
- Waste time on wrong people

**Solution**: Spend 30 minutes upfront mapping. Update quarterly.

### Mistake 5: Trying to Please Everyone
**Problem**: Say "yes" to all stakeholder requests

**Why It Fails**:
- Scope creep
- Nothing ships
- Lose focus

**Solution**: Use stakeholder map to prioritize. Say "no" to low-power stakeholders tactfully.

### Mistake 6: No Follow-Through
**Problem**: Promise updates, then go silent

**Why It Fails**:
- Stakeholders feel ignored
- Trust broken
- They become blockers

**Solution**: Calendar recurring updates. Set reminders.
