# Market Sizing: TAM, SAM, SOM / Định Cỡ Thị Trường

## Overview / Tổng Quan

**English:**
Market sizing answers the question: "How big is the opportunity?" It's essential for strategy, fundraising, and prioritization.

**The Three Market Sizes:**

```
        ┌─────────────────────────────┐
        │   TAM (Total Addressable)   │ ← Everyone who could use product
        │  ┌─────────────────────┐    │
        │  │  SAM (Serviceable)  │    │ ← Segment you can reach
        │  │  ┌───────────────┐  │    │
        │  │  │ SOM (Obtain)  │  │    │ ← What you can capture
        │  │  └───────────────┘  │    │
        │  └─────────────────────┘    │
        └─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Definitions:**

**TAM (Total Addressable Market)**
- The total market demand for your product/service
- "If you had 100% market share, how much revenue?"
- Usually measured in $ or # of users

**SAM (Serviceable Available Market)**
- The segment of TAM you can realistically serve
- Limited by geography, business model, regulations
- Your slice of TAM

**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**
- The portion of SAM you can realistically capture
- Accounts for competition, GTM execution
- Your realistic target in 3-5 years

**Real Example - Uber (2010 Pitch):**

**TAM**: $100B
- Total spent on ground transportation globally
- Taxis + limos + car services

**SAM**: $10B
- Urban areas in countries where rideshare is legal
- Focus on top 50 cities initially

**SOM**: $1B (Year 5)
- Realistic capture given competition (taxis, Lyft)
- Assumes 10% market share in target cities

**Result**: Raised funding, executed strategy, actual 2023 revenue: $37B+ (exceeded SOM)

**Vietnamese:**
Định cỡ thị trường trả lời câu hỏi: "Cơ hội lớn như thế nào?"

**3 Loại Thị Trường:**

**TAM**: Tổng thị trường có thể tiếp cận
**SAM**: Phân khúc bạn có thể phục vụ
**SOM**: Phần bạn có thể chiếm được

**Ví Dụ - Uber (2010):**
- TAM: $100B (toàn cầu)
- SAM: $10B (50 thành phố)
- SOM: $1B (năm 5, 10% thị phần)
- Thực tế 2023: $37B+

## Understanding Each Market Size / Hiểu Từng Loại Thị Trường

**English:**

### TAM (Total Addressable Market)

**What It Tells You:**
- Maximum revenue opportunity
- Market validation (is it big enough?)
- Long-term potential

**Who Cares:**
- VCs (is market big enough to justify investment?)
- Leadership (should we enter this market?)
- Strategy (where to focus long-term?)

**Threshold Guidelines:**
| Company Stage | Minimum TAM |
|--------------|-------------|
| Early-stage startup | $1B+ |
| VC-backed growth | $10B+ |
| Public company | $50B+ |

**Example - Notion (2016):**
```
TAM: $50B (Collaboration software market)

Components:
- Project management: $10B (Asana, Monday.com)
- Documentation: $8B (Confluence, Google Docs)
- Spreadsheets: $12B (Excel, Airtable)
- Note-taking: $5B (Evernote, OneNote)
- Databases: $15B (Airtable, databases)

Logic: Notion replaces all these tools → TAM is sum
```

### SAM (Serviceable Available Market)

**What It Tells You:**
- Realistic addressable market given your constraints
- GTM focus areas

**Constraints That Limit SAM:**
1. **Geography**: You only serve certain countries
2. **Customer segment**: B2B vs B2C, SMB vs Enterprise
3. **Distribution**: Only via app stores, only B2B sales
4. **Product limitations**: Only iOS, only English
5. **Regulatory**: Licensing, compliance requirements

**Example - Duolingo:**
```
TAM: $60B (All language learning globally)

SAM: $10B

Why smaller?
- Only digital learners (not offline classes)
- Focus on casual learners (not professional/academic)
- Free + freemium model (not $5000 courses)
- Initially English speakers learning other languages

Geography: Global (but started US/UK)
Segment: Casual learners, mobile-first
```

### SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)

**What It Tells You:**
- Realistic revenue target for next 3-5 years
- What you put in financial projections
- Guides resource planning

**Factors That Limit SOM:**
1. **Competition**: Market share you can win
2. **Brand awareness**: Takes time to build
3. **Sales capacity**: How many deals can you close?
4. **Product maturity**: Features needed to compete
5. **Marketing budget**: CAC limits growth rate

**Example - Figma (2016 Launch):**
```
SAM: $5B (Cloud-based design tools for teams)

SOM Year 1 (2016): $5M
- 5,000 teams × $1,000/year
- Bottom-up GTM, limited brand awareness
- Competing with entrenched Adobe

SOM Year 5 (2020): $200M
- 200,000 teams × $1,000/year
- Strong brand, word-of-mouth
- 4% of SAM

Actual 2022: $400M ARR (8% of SAM)
Outcome: Acquired by Adobe for $20B
```

**Vietnamese:**

**TAM**: Tối đa có thể
- VCs quan tâm
- Tối thiểu: $1B (startup)

**SAM**: Thực tế phục vụ được
- Giới hạn: địa lý, phân khúc, sản phẩm

**SOM**: Chiếm được thực tế
- Kế hoạch 3-5 năm
- Giới hạn: cạnh tranh, thương hiệu, năng lực

## Calculating Market Size / Tính Toán Quy Mô Thị Trường

**English:**

### Method 1: Top-Down (Market Research)

**Approach**: Start with industry reports, apply filters

**Steps:**
1. Find total market size (industry reports)
2. Apply geographic filter
3. Apply segment filter
4. Apply penetration rate

**Example - Meal Kit Delivery (HelloFresh):**

```
Step 1: Total US food market
= $1.5 trillion/year

Step 2: Groceries (not restaurants)
= $800B (53% of food spending)

Step 3: Urban households making $75K+
= $200B (25% of grocery spending)

Step 4: Willing to try meal kits (10%)
= $20B

TAM: $20B
```

**Pros:**
- Fast
- Credible (uses published data)
- Good for pitch decks

**Cons:**
- Broad assumptions
- May miss nuances
- Not always accurate

**Data Sources:**
- Gartner, IDC, Forrester (tech)
- Statista, IBISWorld (general)
- Government data (census, industry)
- Industry associations

### Method 2: Bottom-Up (Customer Analysis)

**Approach**: Start with customer economics, scale up

**Steps:**
1. Define target customer
2. Count how many customers
3. Calculate revenue per customer
4. Multiply

**Example - Slack (B2B SaaS):**

```
Step 1: Target customer
= Tech companies, 50-500 employees

Step 2: Count companies
= 500,000 companies globally (from databases)

Step 3: Revenue per customer
= 200 employees × $8/user/month × 12 months
= $19,200/year

Step 4: TAM calculation
= 500,000 companies × $19,200
= $9.6B

SAM (focus areas):
= US + UK + Western Europe
= 150,000 companies × $19,200
= $2.9B

SOM (Year 5):
= 5% market share = $145M
```

**Pros:**
- Grounded in customer reality
- More accurate
- Helps with GTM planning

**Cons:**
- Requires more research
- Data may be hard to find
- Time-consuming

### Method 3: Value Theory (Replacement)

**Approach**: How much value does your product replace?

**Steps:**
1. Identify what you replace
2. Calculate current spending
3. Estimate adoption rate

**Example - Zoom (2013):**

```
What Zoom replaces:
- In-person meetings (travel costs)
- Conference room equipment
- Legacy video conferencing (Cisco, Polycom)

Step 1: Travel costs for meetings
= $300B/year in business travel
= Assume 30% could be replaced by video
= $90B

Step 2: Video conferencing market
= $5B/year (existing solutions)

Step 3: Total addressable
= $95B (travel replacement + existing market)

SAM (initial):
= SMB + Mid-market (not enterprise initially)
= $15B

SOM (Year 5):
= $500M (capturing 3% of SAM)

Actual: Zoom hit $4B ARR by 2021
```

**Pros:**
- Captures value creation
- Accounts for market expansion
- Strategic perspective

**Cons:**
- Speculative
- Harder to validate
- May seem inflated

**Vietnamese:**

### 3 Phương Pháp:

**1. Top-Down (Nghiên cứu thị trường)**
- Bắt đầu từ báo cáo ngành
- Áp dụng bộ lọc
- Nhanh, đáng tin, nhưng rộng

**2. Bottom-Up (Phân tích khách hàng)**
- Bắt đầu từ khách hàng
- Đếm số lượng, nhân doanh thu
- Chính xác hơn, mất thời gian

**3. Value Theory (Thay thế)**
- Bạn thay thế gì?
- Tính giá trị thay thế
- Chiến lược, nhưng đầu cơ

## Market Sizing Playbook / Hướng Dẫn Từng Bước

**English:**

### Step 1: Define Your Product/Service (Day 1)

**Be Specific:**
- What exactly are you selling?
- Who is the target customer?
- What's the use case?

**Bad**: "Cloud storage for everyone"
**Good**: "Secure cloud storage for healthcare organizations with HIPAA compliance"

### Step 2: Calculate TAM (Day 1)

**Choose Method:**
- Tech products: Top-down (use analyst reports)
- New category: Value theory (what you replace)
- Clear customer: Bottom-up (count customers)

**Formula Options:**

**Option A (User-based):**
```
TAM = Total Potential Users × Annual Revenue per User
```

**Option B (Market-based):**
```
TAM = Total Market Size × Your Market Share Ceiling
```

**Example - Canva (2013):**
```
Bottom-up:
- Target: 500M people who need design
- ARPU: $120/year (freemium model, $10/month paid)
- TAM: 500M × $120 = $60B

Top-down:
- Graphic design software market: $10B
- Canva's expansion (democratize design): +$50B
- TAM: $60B

Both methods align → confidence in number
```

### Step 3: Calculate SAM (Day 2)

**Apply Filters:**

1. **Geographic Filter:**
   - Which countries can you serve?
   - Language requirements?
   - Regulatory constraints?

2. **Customer Segment Filter:**
   - B2B or B2C?
   - Company size?
   - Industry verticals?

3. **Product/Channel Filter:**
   - Distribution limitations?
   - Platform constraints (iOS only, etc.)?

**Example - Superhuman:**
```
TAM: $30B (all email users globally)

SAM: $500M

Filters applied:
- Geography: English-speaking only (initially)
- Segment: Knowledge workers, executives
- Willingness to pay: $30/month (premium)
- Tech-savvy: Must use keyboard shortcuts

Calculation:
- 10M professionals (0.5% of 2B email users)
- $360/year (12 × $30)
- SAM: 10M × $360 = $3.6B

Realistic SAM (accounting for competition):
- $500M (15% of calculated SAM)
```

### Step 4: Calculate SOM (Day 2)

**Realistic Capture:**

**Year 1-2 (Traction):**
- 0.1-1% of SAM
- Focus: Validation, product-market fit

**Year 3-5 (Growth):**
- 2-10% of SAM
- Focus: Scale, market share

**Year 5+ (Maturity):**
- 10-25% of SAM (if winning)
- Focus: Dominance, expansion

**Factors to Consider:**

1. **Competition:**
   - How entrenched are competitors?
   - What's your differentiation?

2. **GTM Efficiency:**
   - Sales team size?
   - Marketing budget?
   - Customer acquisition cost (CAC)?

3. **Product Readiness:**
   - Feature parity with competitors?
   - Unique capabilities?

**Example - Notion (Actual Path):**
```
Year 1 (2016): $1M
- 10,000 users × $100/year (teams)
- 0.002% of SAM

Year 3 (2018): $20M
- 200,000 users, mix free + paid
- 0.04% of SAM

Year 5 (2020): $200M (estimated)
- 4M users, strong conversion
- 0.4% of SAM

Year 7 (2022): $1B+ (reported)
- 20M+ users
- 2% of SAM

Trajectory: Started tiny, 100x growth in 7 years
```

### Step 5: Validate Your Numbers (Day 3)

**Sanity Checks:**

1. **Compare to Competitors:**
   - What's similar company's revenue?
   - Your SOM should be comparable or smaller (initially)

2. **Check Against Averages:**
   - Average revenue per customer in industry?
   - Does your ARPU make sense?

3. **Expert Validation:**
   - Show to industry experts
   - Get feedback from VCs, advisors

4. **Scenario Analysis:**
   - Best case (aggressive growth)
   - Base case (moderate growth)
   - Worst case (slow growth)

**Example - Validation:**
```
Your calculation: SOM = $50M (Year 5)

Competitor analysis:
- Competitor A (similar): $40M in Year 5
- Competitor B: $60M in Year 5
- Your number: $50M ✓ (reasonable)

If your number was $500M → too aggressive
If your number was $5M → too conservative
```

### Step 6: Document Assumptions (Day 3)

**Create Assumptions Sheet:**

| Assumption | Value | Source | Confidence |
|-----------|-------|--------|------------|
| Total potential users | 10M | Industry report | High |
| Conversion rate | 5% | Competitor avg | Medium |
| ARPU | $100/year | Pricing analysis | High |
| Market share (Y5) | 10% | Competitive analysis | Medium |
| Geographic reach | US, UK, EU | GTM plan | High |

**Why This Matters:**
- Transparent about what's fact vs guess
- Easy to update when you learn more
- Credible with investors

**Vietnamese:**

### Quy Trình 6 Bước:

**Ngày 1:**
1. Định nghĩa sản phẩm/khách hàng
2. Tính TAM (chọn phương pháp)

**Ngày 2:**
3. Tính SAM (áp dụng bộ lọc)
4. Tính SOM (thực tế chiếm)

**Ngày 3:**
5. Xác thực số liệu (so sánh đối thủ)
6. Ghi lại giả định (bảng assumptions)

- 1% take rate = $100M
- 0.2% of TAM

Actual Results:
- 2016: $450M revenue (4.5x SOM) ✓
- 2023: $14B+ revenue
- Expanded TAM by enabling new business models
```

**Key Insight**: TAM expanded as Stripe enabled new use cases

### Example 3: Calm (Meditation App, 2015)

```
TAM: $4B
- Wellness + mental health digital market
- Top-down from industry reports

SAM: $1B
- Mobile meditation app users
- English-speaking countries
- Willing to pay for subscriptions

SOM Year 5 (2020): $100M

## Common Mistakes / Sai Lầm Thường Gặp

### Mistake 1: TAM Too Large (Unrealistic)
**Problem**: "Our TAM is $1 trillion because everyone uses the internet"
**Why Wrong**: Not everyone is your customer
**Solution**: Be specific about target segment

### Mistake 2: Confusing TAM with Revenue Projection
**Problem**: "We'll reach our TAM of $10B in 5 years"
**Why Wrong**: TAM is theoretical maximum, not achievable
**Solution**: TAM shows opportunity, SOM shows realistic target

### Mistake 3: Bottom-Up Doesn't Match Top-Down
**Problem**: Bottom-up = $100M, Top-down = $10B
**Why Wrong**: Likely error in assumptions
**Solution**: Reconcile differences, explain discrepancies

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Competition in SOM
**Problem**: "We'll get 50% market share in 3 years"
**Why Wrong**: Markets have incumbents, switching costs
**Solution**: Realistic market share assumptions (start 1-5%)

### Mistake 5: Static Market Size
**Problem**: Using same TAM for 10-year projection
**Why Wrong**: Markets grow (or shrink)
**Solution**: Project market growth rate (CAGR)

### Mistake 6: No Assumptions Documented
**Problem**: Just numbers, no explanation
**Why Wrong**: Can't defend analysis or update later
**Solution**: Document every assumption with source

## Market Sizing for Different Business Models / Theo Mô Hình Kinh Doanh

**English:**

### SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)

**Formula:**
```
TAM = Number of Companies × Seats per Company × ARPU × 12 months

Example (Project Management SaaS):
- Companies: 500,000 (50-500 employees)
- Seats: 50 (average)
- ARPU: $10/user/month
- TAM: 500,000 × 50 × $10 × 12 = $3B
```

### Consumer App (Freemium)

**Formula:**
```
TAM = Total Users × Conversion Rate × Subscriber ARPU × 12

Example (Meditation App):
- Total users: 100M (interested in meditation)
- Conversion: 5% (freemium standard)
- ARPU: $60/year
- TAM: 100M × 5% × $60 = $300M
```

### Marketplace (Two-Sided)

**Formula:**
```
TAM = GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) × Take Rate

Example (Freelance Marketplace):
- Total freelance market: $1T/year
- Your take rate: 15%
- TAM: $1T × 15% = $150B
```

### Hardware

**Formula:**
```
TAM = Units Sold × Average Selling Price

Example (Smart Home Device):
- Households: 150M (US + EU)
- Penetration: 20% (tech-savvy)
- ASP: $200
- TAM: 150M × 20% × $200 = $6B
```

**Vietnamese:**

**SaaS**: Số công ty × Seats × ARPU × 12
**Consumer**: Users × Conversion × ARPU × 12
**Marketplace**: GMV × Take rate
**Hardware**: Units × ASP
