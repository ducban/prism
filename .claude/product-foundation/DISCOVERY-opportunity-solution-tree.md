# Opportunity Solution Tree

## Overview

**English:**
The Opportunity Solution Tree (OST) is a visual framework created by Teresa Torres in 2016 that helps product teams connect desired business outcomes to customer opportunities, potential solutions, and experiments. It's especially powerful when handling stakeholder-driven requests because it forces you to validate assumptions before building.

**When to use it:**
- CEO/stakeholder requests a specific feature (e.g., "Add AI section to homepage")
- Need to explore problem space before jumping to solutions
- Want to ensure you're solving the right problem
- Multiple potential solutions exist for a business goal

**Vietnamese:**
Opportunity Solution Tree (OST) là framework trực quan do Teresa Torres tạo ra năm 2016, giúp nhóm sản phẩm kết nối kết quả kinh doanh mong muốn với cơ hội của khách hàng, giải pháp tiềm năng và thử nghiệm. Đặc biệt mạnh mẽ khi xử lý yêu cầu từ stakeholder vì nó buộc bạn phải xác thực giả định trước khi xây dựng.

**Khi nào sử dụng:**
- CEO/stakeholder yêu cầu một tính năng cụ thể (VD: "Thêm phần AI vào trang chủ")
- Cần khám phá không gian vấn đề trước khi nhảy vào giải pháp
- Muốn đảm bảo bạn đang giải quyết đúng vấn đề
- Có nhiều giải pháp tiềm năng cho một mục tiêu kinh doanh

Legend:
S = Solution (potential features/products)
E = Experiment (test to validate solution)
```

**The 4 Levels Explained:**

1. **Desired Outcome (Root)**: Business goal you want to achieve
   - Must be specific and measurable
   - Example: "Increase trial-to-paid conversion from 12% to 20% by Q2"

2. **Opportunities (Level 1)**: Customer needs, pain points, or desires
   - Discovered through user research, interviews, data
   - Example: "Users don't understand our value in first 24 hours"

3. **Solutions (Level 2)**: Potential features or products to address opportunities
   - Multiple solutions per opportunity
   - Example: "Interactive onboarding tour" or "AI-powered setup wizard"

4. **Experiments (Level 3)**: Tests to validate if solution will work
   - Must be quick and cheap to run
   - Example: "Figma prototype test with 10 users"

---

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Define Your Desired Outcome**

Start with a clear, measurable business goal.

**Good Examples:**
- "Increase user retention from 40% to 60% in 6 months"
- "Reduce support tickets by 30% this quarter"
- "Grow monthly revenue per user from $50 to $75"

**Bad Examples:**
- "Make users happy" (not measurable)
- "Improve the product" (too vague)
- "Add more features" (output, not outcome)

**For Root:**
If CEO says "Add AI section to homepage", first ask: **What outcome are we trying to achieve?**
- Increase sign-ups?
- Improve brand perception?
- Reduce "What is this?" support questions?

---

**Step 2: Discover Opportunities (Customer Needs)**

Research to find WHY customers aren't achieving your desired outcome.

**Discovery Methods:**
- **User interviews**: "Tell me about the last time you tried to..."
- **Analytics**: Where do users drop off?
- **Support tickets**: What problems do they report?
- **Surveys**: "What prevents you from..."

**For "Add AI section" request:**

Instead of immediately building it, research:
- Opportunity 1: "Visitors don't understand how our product uses AI"
- Opportunity 2: "Technical users want to know AI capabilities before signing up"
- Opportunity 3: "Sales team needs AI messaging to close enterprise deals"

Notice: Each opportunity represents a different user need. The CEO's request might solve one, some, or none of these!

---

**Step 3: Generate Multiple Solutions**

For EACH opportunity, brainstorm 3-5 potential solutions.

**Example for Opportunity 1** ("Visitors don't understand how we use AI"):

Solution ideas:
- Add "AI-Powered" badges next to relevant features
- Create explainer video on homepage
- Add AI section with technical details
- Live demo showing AI in action
- Comparison chart: "With AI vs Without AI"

**Why multiple solutions matter:**
The CEO's request ("Add AI section") is just ONE possible solution. Maybe the live demo would work better? You don't know until you test.

---

**Step 4: Design Experiments**

For each solution, create a quick test BEFORE building it fully.

**Experiment Guidelines:**
- ⏱️ **Fast**: Should take days, not weeks
- 💰 **Cheap**: Minimal engineering effort
- 📊 **Measurable**: Clear success criteria
- 🎯 **Focused**: Test one assumption

**Example Experiments:**

| Solution | Experiment | Success Metric | Time |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------|
| AI section on homepage | Add mockup + intercept 50 visitors for feedback | 70%+ say "Now I understand what you do" | 3 days |
| Live demo | Loom video on homepage for 1 week | 30%+ watch >50% of video | 1 week |
| AI badges | Add badges to 3 features, A/B test | 20%+ increase in trial sign-ups | 2 weeks |

**Result**: Now you have data to show CEO which solution actually works, not just gut feeling!

---

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Better Approach |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Starting with solutions** | "CEO wants AI section, let's build it" | Start with outcome: "Why do we need this? What outcome are we driving?" |
| **One solution per opportunity** | Miss better alternatives | Generate 3-5 solutions per opportunity |
| **Skipping experiments** | Build wrong thing for 3 months | Test with prototype in 3 days |
| **Vague outcomes** | Can't measure success | Make outcomes specific and measurable |
| **Ignoring user research** | Solve problems users don't have | Validate opportunities with real users |

---

### Complete Example: CEO Requests "AI Section on Homepage"

**❌ Traditional Approach (Wrong):**
1. CEO: "Add AI section to homepage"
2. PM: "Sure, I'll have design mock it up"
3. 2 months later: Section launched
4. Result: No impact on metrics. CEO: "Why didn't this work?"

**✅ OST Approach (Correct):**

**Step 1: Clarify Desired Outcome**
PM to CEO: "What outcome are we trying to achieve with the AI section?"
CEO: "We're losing deals because buyers think we're 'just another tool'. I want them to see we're AI-powered and innovative."

**Outcome**: Increase enterprise deal close rate from 15% to 25% in Q1

---

**Step 2: Discover Opportunities** (Research phase - 1 week)

Interviewed 10 lost prospects + 10 sales team members:

**Opportunities Found:**
1. **Opportunity A**: "Buyers can't articulate our differentiation to their leadership"
   - Evidence: 8/10 lost deals said "Couldn't explain why you vs. competitor"

2. **Opportunity B**: "Technical evaluators want AI architecture details"
   - Evidence: Sales team gets 5+ questions per demo about AI infrastructure

3. **Opportunity C**: "Procurement teams concerned about AI costs/risks"
   - Evidence: 6/10 deals stall at legal review due to AI compliance questions

---

**Step 3: Generate Solutions**

**For Opportunity A** (Can't articulate differentiation):
- Solution 1: AI section on homepage
- Solution 2: "Battle card" PDF for champions to share internally
- Solution 3: ROI calculator showing AI-powered efficiency gains
- Solution 4: Video: "How [Customer] closed deals faster with our AI"

**For Opportunity B** (Need technical details):
- Solution 5: Technical AI documentation page
- Solution 6: Architecture diagram in sales deck
- Solution 7: Live demo of AI features during trial

---

**Step 4: Design Experiments** (Week 2-3)

| Solution | Experiment | Duration | Cost |
|----------|-----------|----------|------|
| Battle card PDF | Create 1-pager, test with 5 champions | 3 days | Designer: 4 hours |
| ROI calculator | Figma prototype, walk through with 5 prospects | 5 days | PM: 8 hours |
| AI homepage section | Mockup + UserTesting.com with 20 target buyers | 1 week | $200 + Designer: 8 hours |

---

**Step 5: Run Experiments & Analyze**

**Results after 2 weeks:**

- **Battle card**: 5/5 champions said "This is exactly what I needed to present to my VP"
- **ROI calculator**: 4/5 prospects wanted to use it immediately, requested live version
- **AI homepage section**: 8/20 thought it was "nice but not critical"

**Decision**: Build battle card (2 days) + ROI calculator (1 week) FIRST. Deprioritize homepage section.

**Outcome**: After implementing:
- Deal close rate increased from 15% → 28% (exceeded goal!)
- Time to close decreased by 12 days
- CEO: "This is why we validate before building!"

**Key Insight**: The CEO's requested solution (AI section) was NOT the best solution for the actual business outcome!
