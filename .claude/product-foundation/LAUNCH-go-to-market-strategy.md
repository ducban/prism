# Go-to-Market (GTM) Strategy / Chiến Lược Ra Mắt Thị Trường

## Overview / Tổng Quan

**English:**
A Go-to-Market (GTM) strategy is your comprehensive plan for bringing a product to market and reaching customers. It answers: Who are we selling to? How do we reach them? Why should they buy?

**GTM is NOT just "launching" - it's a complete strategy covering:**
- **Target Market**: Who is your ideal customer?
- **Value Proposition**: Why should they care?
- **Positioning**: How are you different from alternatives?
- **Distribution**: How will customers discover and buy?
- **Pricing**: What will you charge?
- **Marketing**: How will you generate awareness and demand?
- **Sales**: How will you convert prospects to customers?

**Real Example - Slack's GTM:**
- **Target**: Tech startups (not enterprises initially)
- **Value Prop**: "Email killer" - replace internal email
- **Positioning**: Fun, modern team communication (vs. clunky enterprise tools)
- **Distribution**: Freemium + bottom-up (teams, not companies)
- **Pricing**: Free tier → $8/user/month
- **Marketing**: Word-of-mouth, Twitter presence, developer community
- **Sales**: Self-serve (no sales team initially)
- **Result**: 0 → 8,000 customers in 2 weeks, 0 → 500K users in 6 months

**Vietnamese:**
Chiến lược Go-to-Market (GTM) là kế hoạch toàn diện để đưa sản phẩm ra thị trường và tiếp cận khách hàng.

**GTM Trả Lời:**
- Bán cho ai?
- Tiếp cận họ như thế nào?
- Tại sao họ nên mua?

**Ví Dụ - Slack:**
- **Mục tiêu**: Startup công nghệ
- **Giá trị**: Thay thế email nội bộ
- **Định vị**: Giao tiếp vui vẻ, hiện đại
- **Phân phối**: Freemium + bottom-up
- **Kết quả**: 0 → 8,000 khách trong 2 tuần

## The 7-Part GTM Framework / 7 Phần Của GTM

**English:**

### Part 1: Target Market Definition

**Step 1a: Define ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)**
For B2B:
- Industry (e.g., SaaS, Healthcare, Finance)
- Company size (e.g., 50-500 employees)
- Revenue range (e.g., $5M-$50M ARR)
- Geography (e.g., North America, APAC)
- Tech stack (e.g., uses Salesforce, AWS)

For B2C:
- Demographics (age, location, income)
- Psychographics (values, lifestyle, behaviors)
- Usage context (when/where/why they'd use product)

**Step 1b: Create Buyer Personas**
- Who are the decision-makers?
- What are their goals, pains, motivations?
- Where do they get information?

**Example - Notion's ICP (Early Days):**
- **ICP**: Tech-savvy knowledge workers at startups/scale-ups
- **Persona**: "Sarah" - Product Manager, 28-35, uses 10+ tools, frustrated by context-switching
- **Geography**: Initially English-speaking markets

---

### Part 2: Value Proposition & Positioning

**Step 2a: Craft Value Proposition**
Use this template:
```
For [target customer]
Who [statement of need/opportunity]
[Product name] is a [product category]
That [key benefit, compelling reason to buy]
Unlike [primary competitive alternative]
Our product [statement of primary differentiation]
```

**Example - Superhuman:**
```
For busy executives and VCs
Who are overwhelmed by email
Superhuman is an email client
That makes you twice as fast at email
Unlike Gmail
Our product has keyboard shortcuts, speed, and delightful UX
```

**Step 2b: Positioning Map**
Plot competitors on 2 axes that matter to customers

Example - Slack vs. Email vs. Enterprise Chat:
```
      Fun/Modern
          ↑
          │     Slack
          │
Email ────┼──── Microsoft Teams
          │
          │  IBM Sametime
          ↓
      Formal/Enterprise
```

---

### Part 3: Pricing Strategy

**Pricing Models:**
1. **Freemium**: Free tier + paid upgrades (Slack, Notion, Zoom)
2. **Free Trial**: 14-30 day trial → subscription (SaaS standard)
3. **Pay-per-Use**: Usage-based (AWS, Twilio, OpenAI)
4. **Tiered**: Good/Better/Best plans (Most SaaS)
5. **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for large customers

**Pricing Psychology:**
- **Anchor High**: Show expensive plan first
- **Middle Option Bias**: Most pick middle tier
- **Annual Discount**: 20% off annual (improves cash flow)

**Example - Notion Pricing:**
- Free: Individual use, limited blocks
- Personal Pro: $5/month (unlimited blocks)
- Team: $10/user/month (collaboration)
- Enterprise: Custom (SSO, admin, support)

**How to Price Your Product:**
1. **Value-Based**: How much value do you create? (Charge 10-20% of that)
2. **Competitor-Based**: What do alternatives cost?
3. **Cost-Plus**: Your costs + margin (avoid this for software)

---

### Part 4: Distribution Channels

**B2B Channels:**
1. **Direct Sales**: Sales team calls prospects (for >$10K ACV)
2. **Inside Sales**: SDRs call inbound leads (for $3K-$10K ACV)
3. **Self-Serve**: Users sign up themselves (for <$3K ACV)
4. **Channel Partners**: Resellers, integrators (mature products)
5. **Marketplace**: Sell through app stores (Salesforce AppExchange, Shopify)

**B2C Channels:**
1. **App Stores**: iOS App Store, Google Play (mobile apps)
2. **Web Direct**: Users buy from website (SaaS)
3. **Social Commerce**: Instagram, TikTok shops (e-commerce)
4. **Paid Ads**: Google, Facebook, TikTok (performance marketing)
5. **Content/SEO**: Organic search (long-term play)

**Slack's Distribution Evolution:**
- **2013-2014**: Word-of-mouth (team invites team)
- **2015-2016**: Content marketing + integrations
- **2017-2018**: Enterprise sales team (for large deals)
- **2019+**: Direct sales + channel partners

---

### Part 5: Marketing Strategy

**The Marketing Funnel:**
```
Awareness → Interest → Consideration → Purchase → Advocacy
```

**Marketing Tactics by Funnel Stage:**

**Awareness:**
- Content marketing (blog, guides)
- Social media presence
- Paid ads (brand awareness campaigns)
- PR and media coverage
- Events and conferences

**Interest:**
- Email nurture campaigns

- Case studies and testimonials
- Product videos

**Consideration:**

- Product demos
- ROI calculators
- Comparison pages

**Purchase:**
- Sales conversations

- In-app activation

**Advocacy:**
- Referral programs
- User community
- Case study creation

**Example - Dropbox's Early Marketing:**
- **Awareness**: Viral video (1.75M views in 1 day)
- **Interest**: Referral program (invite friends → get storage)
- **Consideration**: Free 2GB tier (try before buy)
- **Result**: 100K → 4M users in 15 months, 35% from referrals

---

### Part 6: Sales Strategy

**Sales Motions:**

**1. Product-Led Growth (PLG)**
- Users try product before buying
- Self-serve onboarding
- Freemium or free trial
- Sales gets involved for expansion/enterprise
- **Example**: Slack, Notion, Figma

**2. Sales-Led Growth**
- Sales reps drive deals
- Demos before trial
- Custom proposals
- High-touch support
- **Example**: Salesforce, Oracle, SAP

**3. Hybrid**
- Self-serve for SMB (<$10K deals)
- Sales team for enterprise (>$50K deals)
- **Example**: Zoom, HubSpot

**When to Use Each:**
| Model | When to Use | ACV Range |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| PLG | Simple product, quick time-to-value, large market | <$5K |
| Sales-Led | Complex product, customization needed, high ACV | >$50K |
| Hybrid | Multiple customer segments, expansion potential | $5K-$50K |

## Common Mistakes / Sai Lầm Thường Gặp

### Mistake 1: Boil the Ocean
**Problem**: Trying to target everyone at once

**Example**: "Our project management tool is for all industries!"

**Solution**:
- Pick ONE segment to start (narrow ICP)
- Dominate that segment
- Expand to adjacent segments

**Correct Approach**: "We're for design agencies with 10-50 employees"

### Mistake 2: Build It and They Will Come
**Problem**: Assuming great product = automatic success

**Reality**: Distribution is as important as product

**Solution**:
- Allocate 50% of resources to GTM
- Test distribution channels early
- Build distribution into product (e.g., viral loops)

### Mistake 3: Wrong Pricing Strategy
**Problem**: Pricing too low (leaves money on table) or too high (no one buys)

**Solution**:
- Test price sensitivity
- Value-based pricing (charge based on value created)
- Start slightly high, easier to discount than raise prices

### Mistake 4: Launching to Everyone at Once
**Problem**: Big bang launch without validation

**Better**: Gradual rollout
1. Alpha (internal team)
2. Beta (design partners)
3. Private launch (waitlist)
4. Public launch

### Mistake 5: No Measurement Plan
**Problem**: Launching without knowing what success looks like

**Solution**:
- Define success metrics BEFORE launch
- Set up analytics properly
- Track cohort by channel

## Related Frameworks / Khung Liên Quan

### Product-Market Fit
**Use Before GTM**: Ensure PMF before scaling GTM
- GTM amplifies PMF (or lack thereof)
- Without PMF: GTM burns money
- With PMF: GTM accelerates growth

### Value Proposition Canvas
**Use for Part 2**: Craft value prop and positioning
- VPC defines what customers need
- GTM defines how to reach them

### TAM/SAM/SOM (Market Sizing)
**Use for Part 1**: Size your target market
- TAM: Total market opportunity
- SAM: Market you can serve
- SOM: Market you can capture
