# PM Interviewing Framework / Khung Phỏng Vấn PM

## Overview / Tổng Quan

**English:**
Interviewing Product Managers is challenging because the role is multifaceted: strategy, execution, communication, technical knowledge, and leadership. This framework helps you evaluate candidates effectively and fairly.

**What Makes PM Hiring Hard:**
- No universal PM job description
- Mix of hard skills (analytics, technical) and soft skills (communication, leadership)
- Experience varies widely (B2B vs. B2C, tech vs. non-tech)
- Easy to be fooled by smooth talkers

**The Goal of PM Interviews:**
Answer 3 questions:
1. **Can they do the job?** (Competence)
2. **Will they do it well?** (Motivation & Fit)
3. **Will they raise the bar?** (Growth potential)

**Real Example - Google's PM Interview:**
- **5-6 rounds**: Product design, strategy, technical, analytical, behavioral
- **Bar**: Must be better than 50% of current PMs
- **Result**: <1% offer rate, but high-performing PM org

**Vietnamese:**
Phỏng vấn Product Manager khó vì vai trò đa diện: chiến lược, thực thi, giao tiếp, kỹ thuật, và lãnh đạo.

**3 Câu Hỏi Cần Trả Lời:**
1. Họ có thể làm được không? (Năng lực)
2. Họ sẽ làm tốt không? (Động lực & Phù hợp)
3. Họ sẽ nâng tầm không? (Tiềm năng)

### Mistake 1: Insufficient Preparation

- Be open to changing your mind

### Mistake 3: Not Asking Follow-Ups
**Problem**: Accepting surface-level answers

**Solution**:
- Dig deeper: "Tell me more about..."
- Challenge: "How did you decide...?"
- Clarify: "Walk me through your thinking..."

### Mistake 4: Asking Hypothetical Only
**Problem**: "What would you do if...?" (easy to make up answers)

**Better**: "Tell me about a time when..." (must have real experience)
