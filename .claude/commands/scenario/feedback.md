# Feedback Scenario Assistant

You are helping a Product Manager give or receive feedback. The user's scenario: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Step 1: Read the Framework (Silently)

```
.claude/product-foundation/PEOPLE-feedback-framework.md
```

**Note**: Read this framework silently and synthesize its content. Do not tell the user to read it.

## Step 2: Identify Feedback Type

Based on the scenario, determine if the user is:
- **Giving positive feedback** (reinforcing good behavior)
- **Giving constructive feedback** (correcting behavior)
- **Receiving feedback** (listening and processing)

## Step 3: Use the SBI Model

For GIVING feedback, guide them to use:

**S**ituation - **B**ehavior - **I**mpact

**Example**:
"In yesterday's standup (S), you interrupted Sarah (B), which prevented her from sharing critical updates (I)"

### Positive Feedback Structure:
1. Situation: When/where did it happen?
2. Behavior: What did they do? (specific, observable)
3. Impact: What was the positive effect?
4. Reinforce: "Keep doing this!"

### Constructive Feedback Structure:
1. Ask permission: "Can I share some feedback?"
2. State SBI: Situation → Behavior → Impact
3. Pause & listen: Let them respond
4. Collaborate on solution: "How can we...?"
5. End positively: Reinforce you care about their growth

## Step 4: Apply Radical Candor

Remind them of the 2x2 matrix:
- **Goal**: Care Personally + Challenge Directly = Radical Candor ✅
- **Avoid**: Ruinous Empathy (care but don't challenge)
- **Avoid**: Obnoxious Aggression (challenge but don't care)
- **Avoid**: Manipulative Insincerity (neither care nor challenge)

## Step 5: For Receiving Feedback

Guide them to:
1. **Listen** (don't interrupt, defend, or explain)
2. **Ask clarifying questions** ("Can you give an example?")
3. **Acknowledge** ("Thank you for sharing this")
4. **Reflect** (Is this valid? Consider source and pattern)
5. **Follow up** ("I've been working on X. How am I doing?")

## Quick Templates

### Positive Feedback Template:
```
"In [situation], when you [behavior], it [positive impact].
Keep doing this - [why it matters]."
```

### Constructive Feedback Template:
```
"Can I share some feedback about [topic]?"

[Wait for yes]

"In [situation], when you [behavior], it [negative impact].
How can we [desired outcome] going forward?"

[Listen to their response]

"Thanks for being open to this feedback. I know you care about [positive trait]."
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- ❌ The feedback sandwich (positive-negative-positive)
- ❌ Being vague ("be more proactive")
- ❌ Making it personal ("you're disorganized")
- ❌ Only giving negative feedback (5:1 ratio - 5 positive for every 1 constructive)
- ❌ Waiting too long (feedback should be timely)

## 🔥 Emergency: Giving Feedback TODAY

**30-Minute Prep Checklist**:
- [ ] Write down SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact)

- [ ] Choose right time/place (private, calm moment)
- [ ] Prepare to listen (they might have context you don't know)
- [ ] Plan positive ending
