# SWOT Analysis Framework / Khung Phân Tích SWOT

## Overview / Tổng Quan

**English:**
SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning framework that evaluates Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. It's one of the most widely used strategy tools, helping teams understand where they stand and what to do next.

**What is SWOT?**
- **S**trengths: Internal advantages (what you're good at)
- **W**eaknesses: Internal disadvantages (what you're not good at)
- **O**pportunities: External favorable conditions (what you could exploit)
- **T**hreats: External unfavorable conditions (what could harm you)

**The SWOT Matrix:**
```
         Internal Factors  │  External Factors
                          │
    ─────────────────────┼──────────────────────
                          │
    STRENGTHS            │  OPPORTUNITIES
    • What we do well    │  • Market trends
    • Unique capabilities│  • Customer needs
    • Competitive edges  │  • Technology shifts
                          │
    ─────────────────────┼──────────────────────
                          │
    WEAKNESSES           │  THREATS
    • What we lack       │  • Competitors
    • Gaps in product    │  • Market changes
    • Resource limits    │  • Regulatory risks
```

**Why SWOT Matters:**
- **Clarity**: Honest assessment of current state
- **Strategy**: Identifies where to focus
- **Alignment**: Gets team on same page
- **Decision-Making**: Data-driven prioritization

**Real Example - Netflix's SWOT (2011):**

**Context**: Netflix deciding whether to split streaming and DVD businesses

**Strengths**:
- 25M subscribers
- Strong brand
- Massive content catalog
- Streaming technology lead

**Weaknesses**:
- Content licensing costs rising
- Limited international presence
- Dependent on postal service (DVD)
- No original content

**Opportunities**:
- Streaming adoption growing 40% YoY
- International expansion (190 countries untapped)
- Create original content (own IP)
- Mobile viewing emerging

**Threats**:
- Amazon, Hulu entering streaming
- Content studios raising prices
- DVD market declining
- Internet ISPs could throttle

**Strategic Decision**:
Based on SWOT:
- **Leverage Strength**: Streaming tech lead
- **Fix Weakness**: Invest in original content (House of Cards, 2013)
- **Seize Opportunity**: International expansion
- **Counter Threat**: Reduce DVD dependency

**Result**: Netflix grew from 25M → 230M subscribers, became dominant streaming platform.

**Vietnamese:**
Phân Tích SWOT là khung hoạch định chiến lược đánh giá Điểm Mạnh, Điểm Yếu, Cơ Hội và Mối Đe Dọa.

**SWOT Là Gì?**
- **S**trengths (Điểm Mạnh): Lợi thế nội bộ
- **W**eaknesses (Điểm Yếu): Bất lợi nội bộ
- **O**pportunities (Cơ Hội): Điều kiện thuận lợi bên ngoài
- **T**hreats (Đe Dọa): Điều kiện bất lợi bên ngoài

**Tại Sao SWOT Quan Trọng:**
- Rõ ràng: Đánh giá trung thực
- Chiến lược: Xác định nơi tập trung
- Căn chỉnh: Đồng bộ đội ngũ
- Quyết định: Ưu tiên dựa trên dữ liệu

### Step 2: Brainstorm Strengths (20 minutes)

**Facilitator asks:**

- ✅ Real-time collaboration (unique tech)
- ✅ Browser-based (no download)
- ✅ Developer handoff (inspect mode)
- ✅ Plugin ecosystem (extensibility)
- ✅ Free tier (viral growth)
- ✅ Community (file sharing, templates)

### Step 3: Brainstorm Weaknesses (20 minutes)

**Facilitator asks:**

### Step 8: Action Planning (30 minutes)

**For each strategy:**
1. **Assign owner**: Who's responsible?
2. **Define timeline**: When will it happen?
3. **Set metrics**: How will we measure success?

## Common Mistakes / Sai Lầm Thường Gặp

### Mistake 1: Confusing Internal vs External
**Problem**: Listing "competitors" as weakness (it's a threat)

**Why It Matters**:
- Strengths/Weaknesses = Internal (you control)
- Opportunities/Threats = External (market forces)

**Solution**:
- Internal: Product, team, resources, processes
- External: Market, competition, regulation, trends

### Mistake 2: Too Generic
**Problem**: "Strong team" or "Market is growing"

**Why It Fails**: Not actionable, could apply to anyone

**Solution**: Be specific
- ❌ "Strong team"
- ✅ "3 ex-Googlers with 10+ years in ML, built similar system at scale"

### Mistake 3: Only Focusing on Positives
**Problem**: 20 strengths, 2 weaknesses (not honest)

**Why It Fails**: Ignoring weaknesses doesn't make them disappear

**Solution**: Be brutally honest. Weaknesses are opportunities for improvement.

### Mistake 4: Analysis Paralysis
**Problem**: Perfect SWOT but no action

**Why It Fails**: SWOT is tool, not goal. Strategy is goal.

**Solution**: Always go from SWOT → Strategies → Action Plan

### Mistake 5: Doing It Once and Forgetting
**Problem**: SWOT from 2 years ago collecting dust

**Why It Fails**: Markets change, competitors evolve

**Solution**: Review quarterly. Update when major shifts happen.

### Mistake 6: Wrong Scope
**Problem**: Company SWOT when you need product SWOT

**Why It Fails**: Too broad or too narrow doesn't help decisions

**Solution**: Define scope upfront. Match SWOT to decision at hand.

### Mistake 7: No Prioritization
**Problem**: 50 items in SWOT, all equal weight

**Why It Fails**: Can't focus on everything

**Solution**: Prioritize top 3-5 in each quadrant. Focus on high-impact items.
