# One-on-One Meeting Framework / Khung Họp 1-kèm-1

## Overview / Tổng Quan

**English:**
One-on-ones (1-on-1s) are the most important meeting a manager has. Done well, they build trust, accelerate growth, and prevent problems. Done poorly, they're a waste of time.

**What Makes 1-on-1s Different:**
- **Not a status update** (that's what standups/Slack are for)
- **Not a project check-in** (that's what project meetings are for)
- **It's the employee's meeting** (not yours)
- **It's about people, not just work** (career, growth, relationships)

**Why 1-on-1s Matter:**

**The Data:**
- **Intel Study**: Managers who do weekly 1-on-1s have 30% higher team performance
- **Gallup**: Employees who have regular 1-on-1s are 3x more engaged
- **15Five Survey**: 77% of employees would work harder if more recognized
- **Retention**: #1 reason people quit is relationship with manager

**Real Example - Intel (Andy Grove):**
Andy Grove, Intel's legendary CEO, invented the modern 1-on-1 in the 1970s:
- **Format**: 30 min weekly, employee sets agenda
- **Rule**: "Manager's job is to listen 80%, talk 20%"
- **Result**: Built Intel's high-performance culture
- **Quote**: "Ninety minutes of your time can enhance the quality of your subordinate's work for two weeks, or for some eighty-plus hours."

**Real Example - Facebook (Mark Rabkin):**
Mark Rabkin (Facebook VP) wrote "The Art of the Awkward 1:1":
- **Problem**: 1-on-1s felt transactional and shallow
- **Solution**: Ask harder questions ("What's frustrating you?" "What's not fun?")
- **Result**: Deeper relationships, earlier problem detection
- **Key Insight**: "The best 1-on-1s feel a bit awkward because you're pushing into uncomfortable territory where growth happens"

**Vietnamese:**
Họp 1-kèm-1 là cuộc họp quan trọng nhất của quản lý. Làm tốt, chúng xây dựng niềm tin, tăng tốc tăng trưởng và ngăn chặn vấn đề.

**1-on-1 Khác Gì:**
- **Không phải cập nhật trạng thái** (dùng standup/Slack)
- **Không phải kiểm tra dự án** (dùng project meeting)
- **Là cuộc họp của nhân viên** (không phải của bạn)
- **Về con người, không chỉ công việc** (sự nghiệp, tăng trưởng)

**Tại Sao 1-on-1 Quan Trọng:**
- Intel: Quản lý làm 1-on-1 hàng tuần có hiệu suất đội ngũ cao hơn 30%
- Gallup: Nhân viên có 1-on-1 thường xuyên gắn kết hơn 3 lần

- **Location**: Private space (office, meeting room, or video)
- **Timing**: Same day/time each week (consistency matters)

### During the 1-on-1

**Opening (First 2 minutes):**

**Manager**: "How are you doing?" (and mean it)
- Listen for energy, mood, stress signals
- Not a throwaway question

**If they're struggling:**
- "I can tell something's off. Want to talk about it?"
- "What's draining your energy right now?"

**Employee's Agenda (20-40 minutes):**

**Let them lead:**
- "What's on your mind?"
- "What do you want to talk about today?"

**If they don't have agenda (have backup questions):**

**Current Work Questions:**
- "What's blocking you right now?"
- "What's going well? What's not?"
- "Where do you need support?"
- "What decisions are you stuck on?"

**Team & Culture Questions:**
- "How's the team dynamic?"
- "Any friction with other teams?"
- "What's frustrating you about how we work?"
- "What should we start/stop/continue as a team?"

**Career Questions:**
- "What do you want to learn?"
- "What parts of your work energize you? Drain you?"
- "Where do you see yourself in 1-2 years?"
- "What can I do to help your growth?"

**The "Awkward" Questions (Rabkin's Approach):**
- "What's not fun about working here?"
- "What would you change about the company if you could?"
- "Who on the team is doing great work? (And why?)"
- "If you were me, what would you change?"
- "What's something I don't know that I should?"

**Manager's Topics (5-10 minutes):**

**1. Give Feedback (Use SBI Model):**
- Positive: "In yesterday's demo, you handled the CFO's tough questions gracefully..."
- Constructive: "I noticed in the last sprint planning..."

**2. Share Context:**
- Company strategy updates
- Leadership decisions that affect team
- Why certain decisions were made

**3. Make Requests:**
- "I need your help with..."
- "Can you take on..."

**Closing (Last 5 minutes):**

**Summarize:**
- "Let me recap what we discussed..."

**Action Items:**
- "You're going to [X], I'm going to [Y]"
- Assign owners and deadlines
- Add to shared doc

**Next 1-on-1:**
- "What should we dive deeper on next time?"

**After the 1-on-1:**

**Manager:**
1. [ ] Complete action items
2. [ ] Update notes in shared doc
3. [ ] Follow up on promises before next meeting
4. [ ] Notice behavior changes (did feedback land?)

**Vietnamese:**

### Trước 1-on-1:
- **Quản lý**: Xem ghi chú lần trước, chuẩn bị phản hồi

### Trong 1-on-1:
1. **Mở đầu**: "Bạn thế nào?" (thực sự quan tâm)
2. **Agenda nhân viên**: Để họ dẫn dắt
3. **Chủ đề quản lý**: Phản hồi, ngữ cảnh, yêu cầu
4. **Kết thúc**: Tóm tắt, hành động

### Sau 1-on-1:

## Skip-Level 1-on-1s / Họp Vượt Cấp

**English:**

Skip-level 1-on-1s are meetings between a leader and their indirect reports (e.g., VP meets with ICs on their team, skipping the manager).

**Why Skip-Levels Matter:**
- **Perspective**: Understand reality on the ground
- **Engagement**: Show you care about everyone, not just directs
- **Early Warning**: Catch issues before they escalate
- **Culture Check**: Assess manager effectiveness
- **Trust**: Build relationships across levels

**How Often:**
- **Frequency**: Monthly or Quarterly
- **Duration**: 30 minutes
- **Who**: All team members (not just high performers or problem cases)

**Skip-Level Structure (30 min):**

**1. Check-In (5 min)**
- "How are you doing?"
- "How's work going overall?"

**2. Manager Effectiveness (10 min)**
- "How are 1-on-1s with [Manager]?"
- "What feedback do you have for [Manager]?"
- "Is there anything [Manager] should start/stop/continue doing?"
- "Are you getting the support you need?"

**3. Team & Culture (10 min)**
- "What's working well on the team?"
- "What's not working?"
- "What would you change about how we work?"
- "Do you feel set up for success?"

**4. Career & Growth (5 min)**
- "What do you want to learn?"
- "What are your career goals?"
- "How can we support your growth?"

**Best Practices:**

**Do:**
- ✅ Share themes with manager (not verbatim quotes)
- ✅ Act on feedback (show it matters)
- ✅ Keep it conversational, not interrogation
- ✅ Make it regular (not just when problems arise)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Go around manager (tell them you're doing skip-levels)
- ❌ Make promises you can't keep
- ❌ Break confidentiality (if they ask for it)
- ❌ Only do skip-levels when manager is struggling

**Real Example - Amazon:**
Amazon requires all leaders to do quarterly skip-levels:
- **Goal**: Ensure managers are effective coaches
- **Format**: "What's [Manager] doing well? What could improve?"
- **Follow-up**: Leaders share aggregate themes in calibration meetings
- **Result**: Continuous improvement of management quality

**Vietnamese:**

### Skip-Level 1-on-1:

**Tại sao quan trọng:**
- Hiểu thực tế trên mặt đất
- Phát hiện vấn đề sớm
- Kiểm tra hiệu quả quản lý

**Cấu trúc 30 phút:**
1. Kiểm tra (5 phút)
2. Hiệu quả quản lý (10 phút)
3. Đội ngũ & văn hóa (10 phút)
4. Sự nghiệp (5 phút)

## Career Development in 1-on-1s / Phát Triển Sự Nghiệp

**English:**

Career conversations should happen regularly in 1-on-1s, not just once a year.

### The Career Conversation Framework

**Step 1: Understand Their Goals (Once per quarter)**

**Questions:**
- "Where do you see yourself in 2 years?"
- "What role would you love to have someday?"
- "What type of work energizes you?"
- "What are you good at that you want to get better at?"
- "What are you not good at that you want to improve?"

**Document their answers** (career development plan)

**Step 2: Identify Growth Opportunities (Ongoing)**

**The 70-20-10 Model:**
- **70%**: Learn through challenging work
  - Stretch projects, new responsibilities, high-visibility tasks
- **20%**: Learn from others
  - Mentorship, peer learning, shadowing
- **10%**: Formal training
  - Courses, conferences, books

**Example Growth Plan:**
```
Goal: Become Staff Engineer in 18 months

70% (Challenging Work):
  - Lead architecture for new payment system (Q1-Q2)
  - Mentor 2 junior engineers (ongoing)
  - Present tech talk at company all-hands (Q3)

20% (Learning from Others):
  - Shadow Sarah (Staff Eng) for 1 month
  - Join architecture review group
  - Find external mentor in engineering community

10% (Formal Training):
  - System Design course (Grokking)
  - Attend QCon conference
  - Read "Designing Data-Intensive Applications"
```

**Step 3: Create Opportunities (Manager's Job)**

**How to Support Growth:**
1. **Delegate meaningfully**: Give stretch assignments
2. **Make space**: Protect time for learning
3. **Connect them**: Introduce to mentors, stakeholders
4. **Sponsor them**: Advocate for promotion
5. **Give feedback**: Tell them how they're progressing

**Step 4: Track Progress (Monthly Check-ins)**

**Questions:**
- "How's the [stretch project] going?"
- "What are you learning?"
- "What's harder than expected? Easier?"
- "Do you need more/different support?"

**Step 5: Celebrate Milestones**

When they achieve growth goal:
- Recognize publicly
- Update job title/level
- Increase compensation
- Create next goal

**Real Example - Stripe (Career Conversations):**
Stripe has quarterly "career 1-on-1s" separate from weekly 1-on-1s:
- **Format**: 60 minutes, focused only on career
- **Doc**: Shared career development plan
- **Topics**: Goals, gaps, growth opportunities, promotion timeline
- **Result**: Clear career paths, high internal mobility

**Vietnamese:**

### Khung Phát Triển Sự Nghiệp:

**Bước 1**: Hiểu mục tiêu (Mỗi quý)
**Bước 2**: Xác định cơ hội tăng trưởng (Liên tục)
**Bước 3**: Tạo cơ hội (Công việc của quản lý)
**Bước 4**: Theo dõi tiến độ (Hàng tháng)
**Bước 5**: Kỷ niệm cột mốc

**Mô Hình 70-20-10:**
- 70%: Học qua công việc thách thức
- 20%: Học từ người khác
- 10%: Đào tạo chính thức

## 1-on-1 Best Practices / Thực Hành Tốt Nhất

**English:**

### The Dos

**1. Protect the Time**
- Don't cancel 1-on-1s (sends message they don't matter)
- If emergency, reschedule same day/week
- Make it recurring, same time weekly

**2. Let Them Drive**
- Employee's meeting, not yours
- They set agenda (you add items at end)
- Listen 80%, talk 20%

**3. Take Notes**
- Shared doc (transparency)
- Action items with owners
- Refer back to previous notes

**4. Go Beyond Status**
- Status belongs in standup/Slack
- 1-on-1s are for coaching, growth, relationships
- Ask "How?" and "Why?" not just "What?"

**5. Build Trust**
- Be present (no laptop, no phone)
- Follow through on commitments
- Admit when you don't know
- Share your own challenges

**6. Mix It Up**
- Not every 1-on-1 needs to be the same
- Sometimes walk & talk
- Sometimes grab coffee
- Sometimes career-focused, sometimes tactical

### The Don'ts

**1. Don't Make It a Status Update**
- ❌ "What's the status of project X?"
- ✅ "What's blocking you on project X?"

**2. Don't Do All the Talking**
- You should talk <20% of the time
- Ask questions, then listen

**3. Don't Avoid Hard Topics**
- Performance issues don't improve by ignoring
- Address concerns early

**4. Don't Break Confidentiality**
- If they share something sensitive, keep it private
- Ask permission before sharing with others

**5. Don't Skip Career Conversations**
- Career development isn't once-a-year
- Dedicate time quarterly minimum

**6. Don't Wing It**
- Review notes beforehand
- Come prepared with feedback
- Have backup questions

**Real Example - Google's 1-on-1 Research:**
Google's Project Oxygen studied 10,000+ manager reviews and found:
- **#1 Manager Quality**: "Is a good coach" (directly correlated with 1-on-1 quality)
- **Best Practice**: Managers who do weekly 1-on-1s score 15% higher on coaching
- **Worst Practice**: Skipping 1-on-1s is #1 predictor of low manager scores

**Vietnamese:**

### Làm:
- Bảo vệ thời gian (đừng hủy)
- Để họ dẫn dắt (80% lắng nghe)
- Ghi chú (shared doc)
- Vượt qua status (coaching, tăng trưởng)
- Xây dựng niềm tin (hiện diện, cam kết)

### Không Làm:
- Biến thành status update
- Nói quá nhiều
- Tránh chủ đề khó
- Phá vỡ bí mật
- Bỏ qua sự nghiệp

---

## Common Mistakes / Sai Lầm Thường Gặp

### Mistake 1: Making It a Status Update
**Problem**: "Give me updates on all your projects"

**Why It Fails**:
- Wastes valuable 1-on-1 time
- Status can be async (email, Slack, docs)
- Misses opportunity for coaching and growth

**Solution**: Read status updates before meeting. Use 1-on-1 for blockers, decisions, coaching.

### Mistake 2: Canceling Frequently
**Problem**: "Sorry, something came up, let's skip this week"

**Why It Fails**:
- Signals employee isn't priority
- Erodes trust
- Problems fester

**Solution**: Protect 1-on-1 time like you protect customer meetings. Reschedule same week if emergency.

### Mistake 3: No Agenda or Preparation
**Problem**: Both show up with "So, what do you want to talk about?"

**Why It Fails**:
- Wastes time
- Feels aimless
- Important topics don't surface

**Solution**: Shared doc for agenda. Both add items before meeting. Review notes from last time.

### Mistake 4: Manager Talks Too Much
**Problem**: Manager shares context for 25 minutes, employee gets 5 minutes

**Why It Fails**:
- Not employee's meeting anymore
- No time for their concerns
- They disengage

**Solution**: 80/20 rule. Listen 80%, talk 20%. Ask questions, then be quiet.

### Mistake 5: Avoiding Difficult Conversations
**Problem**: Know performance is slipping, but don't address it

**Why It Fails**:
- Problems get worse
- Employee doesn't know to improve
- Leads to PIP or termination (unfair surprise)

**Solution**: Address issues early. Use SBI model. "I care about your success, so I need to share..."

### Mistake 6: Only Talking About Work
**Problem**: Never ask "How are you?" or "What's happening in life?"

**Why It Fails**:
- Misses whole person
- Don't see signs of burnout, life stress
- Shallow relationship

**Solution**: Start with personal check-in. People are humans first, employees second.

### Mistake 7: No Follow-Through
**Problem**: Promise to help with something, then forget

**Why It Fails**:
- Destroys trust
- Employee feels unsupported
- They stop asking for help

**Solution**: Write down commitments. Review action items before next 1-on-1. Do what you said.
