# Value Proposition Canvas / Canvas Giá Trị Sản Phẩm

## Overview

**English:**
The Value Proposition Canvas, created by Alexander Osterwalder (inventor of Business Model Canvas), helps ensure product-market fit by mapping what customers need against what you're building. Critical for validating if a requested feature actually solves customer problems.

**When to use it:**
- Validating if a stakeholder request addresses real customer needs
- Designing new features or products
- Entering new market segments
- When customers say "nice feature, but..."

**Vietnamese:**
Value Proposition Canvas, được tạo bởi Alexander Osterwalder (người phát minh Business Model Canvas), giúp đảm bảo sản phẩm phù hợp thị trường bằng cách ánh xạ nhu cầu khách hàng với những gì bạn đang xây dựng. Quan trọng để xác thực xem yêu cầu có thực sự giải quyết vấn đề khách hàng không.

```

### Right Side: Customer Profile (Start Here!)

#### 1. Jobs-to-be-Done
What tasks is the customer trying to accomplish?
- **Functional jobs**: "Prioritize 20 features for next quarter"
- **Social jobs**: "Look competent in front of my team"
- **Emotional jobs**: "Feel confident in my decisions"

#### 2. Pains
What frustrates customers? What risks do they fear?
- **Undesired outcomes**: "Feature failed after 3 months of work"
- **Obstacles**: "Boss doesn't understand why we built X"
- **Risks**: "Might get fired if this product fails"

#### 3. Gains
What would make customers happy? What do they aspire to?
- **Required**: "Features must ship on time"
- **Expected**: "Data to back up my decisions"
- **Desired**: "Recognition as a strategic PM"
- **Unexpected**: "CEO mentions my roadmap in all-hands"

---

### Left Side: Value Map (Design After Understanding Customer!)

#### 1. Products & Services
What you're building or offering.
- **Features**: "RICE prioritization framework"
- **Services**: "AI-generated PRDs"
- **Digital goods**: "Roadmap templates"

#### 2. Pain Relievers
How do your products relieve customer pains?
- Must directly address specific pains from customer profile
- **Example**: "AI validates your prioritization → reduces risk of wrong feature"

#### 3. Gain Creators
How do your products create customer gains?
- Must directly enable specific gains from customer profile
- **Example**: "Auto-generates executive summary → saves 2 hours, looks professional"

---

## Achieving Product-Market Fit

**Fit = When your pain relievers and gain creators address the customer's most important pains and gains.**

### No Fit:
```
Customer: "I need to justify feature decisions to my VP"
Your Product: "Dark mode and custom fonts"
→ Doesn't address their pain!
```

### Good Fit:
```
Customer: "I need to justify feature decisions to my VP"
Your Product: "RICE scoring with automatic executive summary"
→ Addresses pain directly!
```

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Choose a Customer Segment

Don't try to serve everyone. Pick ONE segment to start.

**Bad**: "Product managers"
**Good**: "B2B SaaS PMs at 50-500 person companies launching 1-2 products per quarter"

**For Root:**
- **Segment A**: Solo founders building their first product
- **Segment B**: PM teams at mid-size B2B companies
- **Segment C**: Consultants managing client products

**Pick ONE to start with. (Different segments = different canvases!)**

---

### Step 2: Map Customer Jobs

Interview 5-10 customers in your segment. Ask:

**Discovery Questions:**
1. "Walk me through your typical week as a PM"
2. "What tasks consume most of your time?"
3. "What would you love to accomplish but can't find time for?"
4. "How do you measure if you're doing a good job?"

**Example Results** (for Segment B: Mid-size B2B PMs):

**Functional Jobs:**
- Prioritize features based on ROI
- Write PRDs that engineering actually reads
- Track what's shipped vs. planned
- Present roadmap to executives

**Social Jobs:**
- Look strategic (not just taking orders)
- Align with executive vision
- Get respect from engineering team

**Emotional Jobs:**
- Feel confident in decisions
- Reduce anxiety about "Did I pick the right features?"
- Experience satisfaction when launches succeed

---

### Step 3: Identify Pains

For each job, ask: "What makes this hard? What frustrates you?"

**Example Pains** (for "Prioritize features based on ROI"):

**Current Pain Points:**
- "Spreadsheets with 50 tabs, impossible to maintain"
- "Stakeholders argue based on opinions, not data"
- "Takes 2 weeks to score 20 features manually"
- "No one agrees on impact scoring criteria"
- "VP says 'Just use RICE' but doesn't explain HOW to score Impact"

**Undesired Outcomes:**
- "Built a feature nobody uses after 3 months of effort"
- "Engineering resents me because I keep changing priorities"

**Obstacles:**
- "I don't have time to interview 100 users for Reach estimates"
- "Finance team doesn't share revenue data I need"

**Risks:**
- "What if I prioritize wrong and we miss our targets?"
- "What if competitor ships this first while we're building something else?"

---

### Step 4: Identify Gains

For each job, ask: "What would make you wildly successful? What would delight you?"

**Example Gains** (for "Prioritize features based on ROI"):

**Required Gains** (bare minimum):
- "Finish prioritization in under 1 day (not 2 weeks)"
- "Have data to justify my choices"

**Expected Gains** (standard expectations):
- "Present to stakeholders with confidence"
- "Everyone agrees on the method, fewer arguments"

**Desired Gains** (wants but doesn't expect):
- "VP loves my roadmap and shares it with board"
- "Engineering says 'This makes sense, let's build it'"
- "Recognized as strategic thinker, not just order-taker"

**Unexpected Gains** (wow moments):
- "AI notices I'm about to prioritize wrong and suggests better approach"
- "Automatically learns my company's values and weights features accordingly"
- "CEO mentions my roadmap in investor pitch"

---

### Step 5: Design Your Value Map

Now that you understand the customer, design features that address their pains and create gains.

**Products & Services:**
- `/phase2:rice` command for quick prioritization
- AI auto-fills Reach based on similar past features
- Confidence scoring guide with examples
- Automatic executive summary generation

**Pain Relievers** (must match specific pains!):

| Customer Pain | How We Relieve It |
|--------------|-------------------|
| "Takes 2 weeks to score 20 features" | `/phase2:rice` scores all features in 30 minutes |
| "VP doesn't explain HOW to score Impact" | Detailed Impact scoring playbook (1-3 scale with examples) |
| "Stakeholders argue opinions, not data" | RICE formula gives objective scores everyone can see |
| "Spreadsheets impossible to maintain" | All data stored, no manual spreadsheets needed |

**Gain Creators** (must match specific gains!):

| Customer Gain Desired | How We Create It |
|----------------------|------------------|
| "VP loves my roadmap" | Auto-generates exec summary in language execs understand |
| "Recognized as strategic" | Frameworks like JTBD show you're solving real problems |
| "Finish in <1 day" | AI assistance cuts time by 90% |
| "Engineering trusts me" | Data-driven prioritization, not gut feeling |

---

### Step 6: Test for Fit

**The Fit Test:**
1. List customer's top 3 pains
2. List customer's top 3 desired gains
3. Check: Do your products address ALL of these?

**Example:**

**Top 3 Customer Pains:**
1. "Takes 2 weeks to prioritize 20 features"
2. "Stakeholders argue opinions instead of data"
3. "No clear guidance on HOW to score Impact"

**Your Product (Root):**
1. ✅ `/phase2:rice` takes 30 minutes (addresses Pain #1)
2. ✅ RICE scores provide objective data (addresses Pain #2)
3. ✅ Impact scoring playbook included (addresses Pain #3)

**Result: STRONG FIT** ✅

## Complete Example: CEO Requests "AI Section on Homepage"

### Traditional Approach:
**CEO**: "Add AI section to homepage"
**Team**: Builds it
**Result**: No impact on any metric

### Value Proposition Canvas Approach:

#### Step 1: Who is the customer?

CEO says "Add AI section" → but for whom?
- Website visitors?
- Existing users?
- Enterprise buyers?
- Technical evaluators?

**After research**: Primary customer = Enterprise buyers in evaluation phase

---

#### Step 2-4: Map Customer Profile

**Customer Segment**: Enterprise buyers evaluating AI-powered PM tools

**Jobs-to-be-Done:**
1. **Functional**: "Evaluate if this tool meets our technical requirements"
2. **Social**: "Present findings to procurement/legal teams"
3. **Emotional**: "Feel confident this is the right choice"

**Pains:**
- "Can't tell how this tool is different from [Competitor]"
- "Don't know what AI tech stack they use (matters for compliance)"
- "Legal team will ask 20 questions about AI I can't answer"
- "Boss thinks AI is just hype, needs proof it's real"

**Gains:**
- **Required**: "Clear documentation I can share with legal"
- **Expected**: "Comparison chart vs. competitors"
- **Desired**: "AI demo that shows actual capabilities"
- **Unexpected**: "Tool auto-generates responses to our RFP questions"

---

#### Step 5: Design Value Map

**Option 1: AI Section on Homepage** (CEO's request)

**Pain Relievers:**
- ✅ Addresses: "Don't know what AI tech stack they use"
- ❌ Doesn't address: "Can't differentiate from competitors"
- ❌ Doesn't address: "Legal team will ask 20 questions"

**Gain Creators:**
- ✅ Creates: "Clear documentation to share"
- ❌ Doesn't create: Comparison chart
- ❌ Doesn't create: AI demo

**Fit Score: 2/6 (33%)** → POOR FIT

---

**Option 2: Technical AI Documentation + Comparison Page + Live Demo**

**Pain Relievers:**
- ✅ Technical docs address legal questions
- ✅ Comparison chart shows differentiation
- ✅ Live demo proves AI is real, not hype

**Gain Creators:**
- ✅ Docs shareable with legal team
- ✅ Comparison chart exists
- ✅ Demo shows capabilities

**Fit Score: 6/6 (100%)** → STRONG FIT

---

#### Step 6: Recommendation to CEO

"CEO, you requested an AI section on the homepage. We used the Value Proposition Canvas to validate this with 10 enterprise buyers.

**Finding**: Homepage section alone only addresses 33% of their pains/gains.

**Better solution** (addresses 100%):
- Technical AI documentation page (for legal teams)
- Comparison chart vs. competitors (for evaluation)
- Live demo during trial (to prove AI works)

**Effort:**
- Option 1 (Homepage section): 2 weeks
- Option 2 (Full solution): 3 weeks

**Recommendation**: Build Option 2. Only 1 extra week but 3X better fit."

**CEO Response**: "This is exactly the kind of thinking I want to see. Build Option 2."

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Better Approach |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Starting with features instead of customer** | Build things customers don't need | Always start with Customer Profile (right side) |
| **Serving multiple segments with one canvas** | Different segments = different needs | One canvas per segment |
| **Assuming pains/gains without research** | Your assumptions ≠ customer reality | Interview 5-10 real customers |
| **Generic pain relievers** | "Makes life easier" addresses nothing specific | Each pain reliever must match a specific pain |
| **Not testing for fit** | Ship products that don't address top pains | Always verify you address top 3 pains + gains |

## Vietnamese Summary / Tóm Tắt Tiếng Việt

**Value Proposition Canvas có 2 phần:**

### Customer Profile (Bên phải - Bắt đầu từ đây):
- **Jobs-to-be-Done** (công việc cần làm): Functional (chức năng), Social (xã hội), Emotional (cảm xúc)
- **Pains** (vấn đề): Undesired outcomes (kết quả không mong muốn), Obstacles (trở ngại), Risks (rủi ro)
- **Gains** (lợi ích mong muốn): Required (bắt buộc), Expected (mong đợi), Desired (khao khát), Unexpected (bất ngờ)

### Value Map (Bên trái - Thiết kế sau):
- **Products/Services** (sản phẩm/dịch vụ): Những gì bạn xây dựng
- **Pain Relievers** (giảm vấn đề): Giải quyết các Pains cụ thể
- **Gain Creators** (tạo lợi ích): Tạo ra các Gains cụ thể

### Product-Market Fit
**Product-Market Fit** = Khi Pain Relievers và Gain Creators giải quyết đúng những Pains và Gains quan trọng nhất của khách hàng.

### Quy Trình 6 Bước:
1. **Chọn phân khúc khách hàng** cụ thể (không phải "tất cả mọi người")
2. **Phỏng vấn 5-10 khách hàng** để hiểu Jobs-to-be-Done
3. **Xác định Pains** (vấn đề họ gặp phải)
4. **Xác định Gains** (lợi ích họ mong muốn)
5. **Thiết kế Value Map** (sản phẩm giải quyết Pains và tạo Gains)
6. **Kiểm tra Fit** (sản phẩm có giải quyết top 3 pains + gains không?)

### Nguyên Tắc Quan Trọng:
- Luôn bắt đầu từ Customer Profile (bên phải), không bắt đầu từ tính năng
- Một phân khúc = một canvas (không dùng chung cho nhiều phân khúc)
- Phỏng vấn khách hàng thật, không tự suy đoán
- Mỗi Pain Reliever phải khớp với một Pain cụ thể
- Kiểm tra xem có giải quyết được top 3 pains và gains không

## Related Frameworks

### Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)
The Jobs-to-be-Done framework complements VPC by providing a deeper understanding of customer motivations. Use JTBD to inform the "Jobs" section of your Customer Profile.

**Integration**: Start with JTBD interviews to understand the functional, social, and emotional jobs customers are hiring your product to do, then map these directly into the VPC.

### Opportunity Solution Tree
The Opportunity Solution Tree helps organize and prioritize opportunities discovered through VPC analysis. After identifying pains and gains, use OST to structure your solution exploration.

**Integration**: Customer pains from VPC become "opportunities" in your OST. Your pain relievers become "solutions" that you test and iterate on.

### Kano Model
The Kano Model categorizes features by customer satisfaction impact, helping you prioritize which gains to target first (basic, performance, or delighters).

**Integration**: Use Kano to prioritize which gains from your VPC to address first. Required/Expected gains map to Kano's Basic features, Desired gains to Performance features, and Unexpected gains to Delighters.

## Root Integration

### Phase 3: Document & Plan

The Value Proposition Canvas is integrated into Root's Phase 3 commands:

#### `/phase3:research`
Use VPC to validate stakeholder requests against real customer needs before creating detailed research plans.

**Example workflow:**
1. Stakeholder requests feature
2. Run `/phase3:research` which prompts you to fill VPC
3. AI helps you identify if request addresses top customer pains/gains
4. Generates research questions to validate fit

#### `/phase3:prd`
Use VPC insights to write PRDs that clearly articulate customer value, not just feature specifications.

**PRD sections informed by VPC:**
- **Problem Statement**: Drawn from customer Pains
- **Success Metrics**: Drawn from customer Gains
- **User Stories**: Drawn from Jobs-to-be-Done
- **Value Proposition**: Directly from Pain Relievers and Gain Creators

---

## Quick Reference Card

### When to Use VPC
- ✅ New feature/product ideation
- ✅ Validating stakeholder requests
- ✅ Entering new market segments
- ✅ Low product adoption (fit issues)
- ✅ High churn (not addressing pains)

### When NOT to Use VPC
- ❌ Technical debt (internal problem)
- ❌ Bug fixes (no discovery needed)
- ❌ Known customer requests (already validated)
- ❌ Optimizations (use A/B testing instead)

### Key Success Factors
1. **Talk to real customers** (not stakeholders)
2. **One segment per canvas** (don't generalize)
3. **Be specific** (avoid generic pain relievers)
4. **Test for fit** (address top 3 pains + gains)
5. **Iterate** (canvases evolve with learning)
